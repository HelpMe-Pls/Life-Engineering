- CRUD lessons & courses 
- Handle videos
- CRUD `page_content`
- Aspect ratio for imgs
- Fix full page scroll / initial load page position
- Keep the sidebar opened and highlight the selected `navItem` when navigating WITHIN that `navItem`
- Improve UX:
	+ Collapsible sidebar (ref Docusaurus)
	+ Fixed sidebar: in `dashboard` and `lesson-detail` page scroll/load, it should be locked with the Header. Only 2 scroll containers enabled for those pages: Main Content and WITHIN the sidebar (i.e. the WHOLE sidebar never gets scrolled. Only its children is scrollable)  
- Clean up nav links (in footer & header): Courses + FAQs + Support + Report Bugs + Copyrights 
- Buy domain & go live
