# Subtleties
- Facial expressions and gestures give signals that _subconsciously_ effect people's mood. You may not notice it, but these are the things that project your _perceived_ value, which means that even if you're highly competent, missing out on these subtleties will inadvertently drag you down. 
> A fine-tuned balance between warmth and competence is what makes a person attractive.
## Facials
- Straight and relaxed gaze. The trick is to end your key messages with your eyes on them. You can look around while you're talking, but on the last 5 letters, make eye contact. It signals competence.
- Smile more often. Gentle smiles, feel as if your mood is lit up by your smile. It signals warmth.
- When they're saying something interesting, flex your lower eyelid (as if you're squinting your eyes trying to look for something from afar). It signals that you're deeply listening and genuinely care about them. Use this sparingly (especially they're sharing something personal)
	- Notice that if they do this trick on you, it's a cue to clarify your statements and gather feedback with something like "Does that make sense?" or "Any questions?". It's signals either confusion or skepticism. Your job is to figure out which one is it.  
## Gestures 
- Flash your palm more often (especially on first impression). It signals that you have no bad intentions, unarmed. 
- Handshake: thumb up & make it firm _just enough_ so that you grip their hand fully. Cupping (i.e. shake with both hands) signals warmth, so do it with a smile.
	- _Not recommended_: If it gets adversarial, tighten your grip, pronate your palm and pull them in towards your body. 
- Relax your shoulders, depress your scapular so that you maximize the distance between your earlobe and the side delts. It signals warmth.
- A _slight_ head tilt or lean forward also signals warmth. Works best when paired with the lower eyelid flex. Use these intentionally. Overuse could make you look weak.
- Triple nods: _slowly_ and gently nod three times in a row when they're telling you something good. It's like a non-verbal ellipsis. It signals warmth. 
	- If you want to wrap up, give them a _fast_ triple-nod.
- When you're discussing something technical, do the steeple hand gesture (keep it static, do _**not**_ tap your fingers). It signals competence.
	- Aligning your elbows 45 degrees from your body and place them on the table also signals competence and confidence. 
> [!danger]- Manipulative agreement
> - When you're trying to persuade someone about your stories/statements, put your hand in front of your face and **_roll_** it forward (in **circular** motion) as if you're nodding with your hand (then you nod your head along). You know you got them when they actually nodding along.
## Vocal cues
- _**==End your statement with LOW intonations==**_. Statements end with a high pitch signal uncertainty and dishonesty. It signals that you're seeking validation, therefore, low competence.
- Low intonation often indicates that a statement is complete and definitive. It conveys a sense of finality and certainty. Use it when you want to stand your ground. 
# Cold outreach
## For business/career
- Send out your invitation (preferably via email) on Monday or Tuesday and ask to meet them later in the week.
- Informal meetings are for you to gather information, test your ideas and gain new insights. They are **NOT** to get hooked up with a job. Never ask for one here.
> [!important] Lead with value
> - Find out what they need so that you can give them something valuable in that domain, or even better, something you've already mastered.
> - Figure out what this person cares about, what their challenges are, and how those challenges relate to areas you might be able to help, and then propose that you help them.
> 	- Something like "_What are you really ==excited about== in your work/business right now?_" or "What have been ==some of the **challenges**== you have been facing in order to achieve that?" (remember not to use the word "problems")
> - What you're trying to build is a win-win reciprocal relationship with them. 
### Email
- Be enthusiastic and authentic. Here's an example of a good cold email:
_Hi Steve,
Greetings from a fellow UCLA alum! I was doing some research on Project Manager positions on LinkedIn, and I noticed you're a Project Manager at Acme._
- Let them know who you are and why you’re writing. Even better if you have something in common or a mutual connection.

_I'm on a quest for my dream job and would love to ask you 3-5 questions about your experience at Acme. Would you be available for a quick chat over coffee this Thursday at 10am? I'm also free any time Friday._
- A single request with proposed time and alternate times. Be specific, frame them to answering a yes/no question.

_Sincerely,
John Smith
P.S. I'm sure you're busy, so if it's easier for you, I'd be happy to send my questions via email. Hope to connect with you soon!_
- Having alternate options shifts their thinking from “Should I?” to “Which one?”
#### Asking a friend for an introduction to one of their contacts
- Send your friend a pre-formatted email to warm up, something like:

    _Hey `Someone`,
    I noticed you’re connected to Jennie Jones at Acme on LinkedIn. I would love to chat with her to get some advice about Acme. I promise to be respectful of her time._

    _Would you mind connecting me? I can send you a pre-formatted introductory email to make things really easy for you. Is that OK?_

    _Thanks,
    Khoi_
- If that `Someone`, said "yes", follow up with this:

    Subject: Jennie, meet Khoi (considering interviewing at Acme). Khoi, meet Jennie.

    _`Someone`, here’s a forwardable email. It should be ready to send, but please feel free to edit as needed!_

    _Thanks,
    Khoi_

    —————————
    _Khoi, please meet Jennie, who is an SVP at Acme.
    Jennie, Khoi is a friend of mine and currently a project manager at Bluth Corp. He’s excellent at user-centered design and is curious about some of the opportunities at Acme. He wondered if you could spare 10 minutes to chat on the phone._

    _Khoi, can you take it from here?_

    _Thanks,
    `Someone`_
#### Warming up an old contact
- Acknowledge that you’ve been out of touch and then move on to your point (don’t dwell on it):


    _Hello `Someone`,_

    _You and I met at the `Conference` last summer, where we talked about `The topic`. I’m currently at Bluth Corp working as a security researcher. I have to admit, I did a terrible job of keeping in touch after the conference. My apologies! But I hope it’s OK to reach out today._

    _I’ve been doing some research on potential career paths and consulting is one that keeps coming up as a possible fit. I noticed you worked at Acme and -- if it’s OK with you -- I would love to ask you a few questions about your experiences at Acme._

    _Do you have time for a 30 minute phone call next week? I’m free Wednesday, Nov 16 1:00pm–4:00pm Eastern or Thursday, Nov 17 2:30pm-4:00pm Eastern. I can also be flexible around your schedule._

    _I would really appreciate it._

    _Sincerely,
    Khoi_

    _P.S. I understand you’re busy, so if it’s easier for you, I’d be happy to send my questions via email. Thanks again._
### Asking the right questions
- It is highly recommended to give your side of the story to set the context before asking a question, for example:
	- _“I've been working at `z` company for 3 years, and it's been quite a ride. I was expecting to be working in a English speaking environment, but it turns out that I've only been working with Vietnamese. So, as someone who’s been in the `x` industry for `y` years, what has been the biggest surprise to you?”_
- Craft your questions so that in the end, you can have a clear answers for these 2 questions:
	- Would I like this job?
	- Can I get this job?
- If so, you can move forward. If not, you need to stop, step back and adjust either your target job role or your target companies.
- Pivot your questions around their experiences in their positions. Do _**not**_ ask surface-level questions such as: “How’s the salary there?” or “How many hours do you guys work in an average week?”. Instead, ask them questions like:
	- "What do you love/hate the most about your role/company?"
	- "What could have been better about the benefits/responsibilities for your position?"
	- "Besides raw talent/experience, what's the number 1 expectation on your role/what separates the wheat from the chaff?"
### Follow up
- With these 3 steps, you keep them informed and they'll automatically peg you as a winner and you move to the top of their mind when opportunities arise:
- **Thank you** (right after or on the following day of your informal meeting):
_Hi Steve,
Just wanted to `thank you again` for meeting with me earlier. I’m definitely going to get
in touch with Susan like you recommended. `I’ll keep you in the loop`, and of course,
please let me know if there’s anything I can do to `repay the favor`! 
Khoi_
- **Add value** (1-2 weeks later):
_Hey Steve,
Saw this article in the Wall Street Journal and it `reminded me of what you said about`
productivity tests! `No response needed`, just thought you might find it interesting.
Khoi_
- **Close the loop** (2-3 weeks later):
_Hi Steve,
Wanted to `give you an update`: I did end up talking to Susan, and you were right —
Acme is definitely a fit for me.
I’m reaching out to a friend there to learn all I can about Acme before I apply. If there’s
anyone else you think I should speak to, please let me know.
Thanks again! `I’ll let you know how it goes`.
Khoi_
### Ghosted ?
- Send an email 3 days later, **replying to the original message**, like this:
    _Re: Hi from Scott -- would love to chat about Accenture

    _Hi John,
    This is Scott from Acme following up. I know your inbox must be flooded, so I didn't want this to fall through the cracks...
- After no response on this follow-up, move on to your next targets. There are plenty of fish in the sea.
## For the joy of making new friends
- Are you working on anything exciting recently?
- What's your biggest goal right now?
- Which type of event/activity do you consider energy inducing?

# Deep talk
## Questions
> [!info]- What is this about?
> - The trick is to ask a question and then listen deeply so that you can ask more follow up questions from their answers. 
> - The key is to be empathetic and compassionate. Imagine yourself in their position. 
> - Try to bring up what they're trying to say but couldn't get it straight.
> - You're there to learn about THEM. Don't make it too much about yourself. Immerse in their story from your POV. Tell your side of the story to lead the conversation. The goal is to practice deep listening, to observe & learn about human nature.
> - To bring out more from them, ask "why/why not; how; tell me more about..."
### For everyone
- Tell me about yourself. What brings you here?
- Tell me what's unique about you that separate you from an average person. Something that you're proud of. Something productive/positive that an average person could do, but wouldn't do, and you managed to be good at it. Something that you really enjoy yourself and time goes fast when you're in it.
- What are your insecurities?
- Tell me about something interesting that you recently learnt. How did you learn that?
- What's your rich life? Are those things the same things that make you happy?

- What's the most valuable thing in your opinion?
- How lucky do you feel?
- Which of your current values would be different if you were raised by different parents?
- What, if anything, makes a person good?
- Have you ever committed a crime?
> [!danger]- Disagreement
> If you caught yourself in an argument, you can deescalate it with thoughtful concession by first acknowledging their idea (slightly confirm it), then softening your disagreement like "While it's true that `their idea`, in my experience, I _**guess**_ I'll disagree."
- Who is your guardian? Someone who raises your awareness and helps you from taking unnecessary risks? Someone who you trust to give advice and make you feel safe in the face of uncertainty. Do you feel that the person also prevents you from taking opportunities? 
- Are you a religious person? What's the role of religion in your life?
- Do you believe that life is intrinsically blissful or suffering? Why?

- What did you fail at this week?
- What does your ideal relationship look like?
- What do you believe the most with the least amount of evidence of it being true?
- Do you spend more time defending what you already know instead of trying to learn something new?
> [!info]- Talk about values
> I think you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you. The first time someone acts this way, I will warn them. By the way, nobody changes. Then I just distance myself from them. I cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: “The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be.”
- What annoys you about other people that you sometimes do yourself?
- Tell me about some things that you really want to do, but didn't do/pursue it because someone else just talking it down.
- What are your usual stressors/frustration? Tell me more about the things that you considered mentally painful. Why? How are you handling them?
- What was the most challenging period in your life and what did you learn from it?
- Tell me more about the last time you had an emotional breakdown.
- Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?
- Tell me about an event that made you realized you've been coping/lying to yourself, and it made you accept the thing you're trying to hide so that you can peacefully live with it. 
- Do you want to be the world's best player and known as the worst, or the world's worst player and known as the best ?
- What are some of the things that you think you deserve to have, but you couldn't have it? Why?
- Are you being as nice as you could be, rather than just as nice as you need to be?
>[!important]- Opinions and the Ego
>- Don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities.
>- Praise the person, and call out exactly what you're praising them for, specifically.
>- Then people’s egos and identities, which we all have, don’t work against you. They work for you.

### For potential mate

- What is a compromise you've had to make since meeting me?
- What was the most recent experience that made you feel closer to me?

## Reconnecting
- Text or call your valued connection when something pops up that remind you of them.
- Mention your "last time" together. For example, "`This` reminds me last time we talked about `xyz`..."
	- Even better if that "last time" was about something memorable. Try to be more aware in your conversations so you can get more of this.
- Call people by their name. It makes them feels special.
