# For everyone
> The trick is to ask a question and then listen deeply so that you can ask more follow up questions from their answers. 
> Be compassionate. Imagine yourself in their position. 
> Try to bring up what they're trying to say but couldn't get it straight.
> You're there to learn about THEM. Don't make it too much about yourself. Immerse in their story from your POV. Only tell your side of the story when they're out of things to say. The goal is to practice deep listening, to observe & learn about human nature.
> To bring out more from them, ask "why/why not; how; tell me more about..."
- Tell me about yourself. What brings you here?
- Tell me what's unique about you that separate you from an average person. Something that you're proud of. Something productive/positive that an average person could do, but wouldn't do, and you managed to be good at it. Something that you really enjoy yourself and time goes fast when you're in it.
- What are your insecurities?
- Tell me about something interesting that you recently learnt. How did you learn that?
- What's your rich life? Are those things the same things that make you happy?
- Tell me about something beautiful. Something artistic (a favorite/recent movie, song, writing,...), or a wholesome moment/memory and why do you think it's beautiful.
- What's the most valuable thing in your opinion?
- Who is your guardian? Someone who raises your awareness and helps you from taking unnecessary risks? Someone who you trust to give advice and make you feel safe in the face of uncertainty. Do you feel that the person also prevents you from taking opportunities? 
- Are you a religious person? What's the role of religion in your life?
- Do you believe that life is intrinsically blissful or suffering? Why?
- What are the traits that you think your generation is handling it better than the previous gen? What are some of the things that most of your gen is missing out?
- What would be your advice to the people of your gen?
- Which of your current values would be different if you were raised by different parents?
- What are the things about your life that making you "feel behind"? Are those the things you do that you know you shouldn't do?
- What does your ideal relationship look like?
- What do you believe the most with the least amount of evidence of it being true?
- Do you spend more time defending what you already know instead of trying to learn something new?

- What annoys you about other people that you sometimes do yourself?
- Tell me about some things that you really want to do, but didn't do/pursue it because someone else just talking it down.
- What are your usual stressors/frustration? Tell me more about the things that you considered mentally painful. Why? How are you handling them?
- What was the most challenging period in your life and what did you learn from it?
- Tell me more about the last time you had an emotional breakdown.
- Tell me about an event that made you realized you've been coping/lying to yourself, and it made you accept the thing you're trying to hide so that you can peacefully live with it.
