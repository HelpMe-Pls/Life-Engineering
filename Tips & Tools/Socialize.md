# For everyone
> The trick is to ask a question and then listen deeply so that you can ask more follow up questions from their answers. 
> Be compassionate. Imagine yourself in their position. 
> Try to bring up what they're trying to say but couldn't get it straight.
> You're there to learn about THEM. Don't make it too much about yourself. Immerse in their story from your POV. Only tell your side of the story when they're out of things to say. The goal is to practice deep listening, to observe & learn about human nature.
> To bring out more from them, ask "why/why not; how; tell me more about..."
- Tell me about yourself. What brings you here?
- Tell me what's unique about you that separate you from an average person. Something that you're proud of. Something productive/positive that an average person could do, but wouldn't do, and you managed to be good at it. Something that you really enjoy yourself and time goes fast when you're in it.
- What are your insecurities?
- Tell me about something interesting that you recently learnt. How did you learn that?
- What's your rich life? Are those things the same things that make you happy?

> [!info]- Talk about values
> I think you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you. The first time someone acts this way, I will warn them. By the way, nobody changes. Then I just distance myself from them. I cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: “The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be.”
- What annoys you about other people that you sometimes do yourself?
- Tell me about some things that you really want to do, but didn't do/pursue it because someone else just talking it down.
- What are your usual stressors/frustration? Tell me more about the things that you considered mentally painful. Why? How are you handling them?
- What was the most challenging period in your life and what did you learn from it?
- Tell me more about the last time you had an emotional breakdown.
- Tell me about an event that made you realized you've been coping/lying to yourself, and it made you accept the thing you're trying to hide so that you can peacefully live with it.

- What are some of the things that you think you deserve to have, but you couldn't have it? Why?
>[!important]- Opinions and the Ego
>- Don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities.
>- Praise the person, and call out exactly what you're praising them for, specifically.
>- Then people’s egos and identities, which we all have, don’t work against you. They work for you.
