How to make a living:
- **Documenting & thinking** – the ability to communicate the value in your unique mind. That is what this entire repo represents. It's the foundation of getting in front of other people. (Research, logic)
- **Marketing & sales** – if you don’t know how to attract and [[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |persuade]], you will never get what you want, and your only option will be for an employer (or the government) to give it to you. (Rhetoric, psychology)
- **Entrepreneurship** – the process of taking my future into your own hands, hunting for your survival, and building products that you want to see in the world (that others *care* about). (Statistics, agency, investment)
- **Job** – if this is your thing, you want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you’re tracked on the outputs. If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you. Especially if they don’t know how you did it because it’s innate to your obsession or your skill or your innate abilities, they’re going to have to keep paying you to do it.
To learn these skills, you must embrace a self-experimentation mindset.

> If you’re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it’s going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process.

> They say “Do what you love and the money will follow!”. How does that sound to you? Most of the time, you don't even know what you actually "love", or even if there's a thing that you're "passionate" about, so what are the chances that you'll be able to make a living out of it?
> 
> I say, do what you love, focus on **the process** to be _exceptional_ at it, and see how you can **turn it into** something that address a **need**, something that helps others, as many and as profoundly as possible, then, and only then, money follows. You're motivated by a greater good - something that makes us thrive, collectively.
> Choose the problem you want to solve and the solution you want to provide. Your **solution** - not your "passion" - is what attracts money. People pay for solutions, not for your enjoyment. They pay for solved problems.
> 
> If you solely "follow your passion", then you'll end up chasing money. Your passion ineluctably requires money to be sustainable. The harder you chase something, the further it gets away from you. When you're chasing something, you're focusing on the event, not the process. There's no event if there's no process.
> When you're chasing money, money owns you. You'll feel forced to make money. When love is force, it inevitably deteriorates.
> 
> All that said, am I against "follow your love/passion"? No, I strongly encourage it. But when you tie "money" with it, you should take a step back and recalibrate.
> 
> The ultimate goal of having money is to not think about money. When you have enough money, you'll be able to "do what you love" just for the sake of it. Irony? Yes. That's life.
