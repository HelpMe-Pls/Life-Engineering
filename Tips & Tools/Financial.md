How to make a living:
- **Documenting & thinking** – the ability to communicate the value in your unique mind. That is what this entire repo represents. The foundation of getting in front of other people. (Research, logic)
- **Marketing & sales** – if you don’t know how to attract and [[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |persuade]], you will never get what you want, and your only option will be for an employer (or the government) to give it to you. (Rhetoric, psychology)
- **Entrepreneurship** – the process of taking my future into your own hands, hunting for your survival, and building products that you want to see in the world (that others *care* about). (Statistics, agency, investment)
To learn these skills, you must embrace a self-experimentation mindset.
