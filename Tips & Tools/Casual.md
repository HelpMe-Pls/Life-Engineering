# Maintaining a convo
> The trick is to ask a question and then listen deeply so that you can ask more follow up questions from their answers. 
> Be compassionate. Imagine yourself in their position. 
> Try to bring up what they're trying to say but couldn't get it straight.
> You're there to learn about THEM. Don't make it too much about yourself. Only tell your side of the story when they're out of things to say.
- Tell me about yourself. Why are you here?
- What's your rich life? Are those things the same things that make you happy?
- Tell me about something beautiful. Something artistic (a favorite/recent movie, song, writing,...), or a wholesome moment/memory and why do you think it's beautiful.
- Tell me what's unique about you that separate you from an average person. Something that you're proud of. Something an average person could do, but wouldn't do, and you managed to to be good at that. Something that you really enjoy yourself and time goes fast when you're in it.
