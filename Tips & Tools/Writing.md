- How do you attract people? Value.
- What is the best way to deliver said value? Media or content.
- What is the foundation of media or content? Writing.
- What does writing mean? To connect the dots - which are your thoughts, ideas, and the purpose behind them - and then extract, deliver them in the best possible manner. To write is to think. To think is to evolve. Writing is often the process by which you realize you do not understand what you are talking about.
- Good writing is felt instantly. Not only is it packed with ideas and insight, it has a certain momentum that compels you to keep reading.
- If you can write about your interests, you can generate new opportunities, and set yourself up for future monetization of said interests.
- Such writing attracts attention, delivers a high-value message, and encourages people to follow you and your work, eventually raise the collective well-being.
> You were put on this earth to piece together the puzzle of reality – your writing is how you document your findings.

# Preparation
- It is recommended to divide your working hours into 2 blocks: creative and then productive.
- You can tap into the creative (and chaotic) unconscious mind through **big picture thinking**, i.e. zooming out so that you can recognize patterns and pick your aim. *Creativity is about connection*.
- You can tap into the productive (and ordered) conscious mind through deep & narrowed-down focus, i.e. now that you got your aim, tap into flow state to aid your execution. *Productivity is about clarity & execution*.
- When your creative work aligns with the goals and tasks you have planned for a specific work block, you meet the requirements for reaching the flow state.
- As a content creator, it is your job to create, produce, and *remix* from a database of content, quotes, anecdotes, metaphors, problems, [[Entrepreneurship#The values |benefits]], topics, ideas, words, and other things that will lead to you creating truly unique content.
> Your content is the projection of your mind that creates a world for others to explore.
## Research
- Everything you consume (or research) now has practical application. Which areas of your life can it apply to? You will only know this if you are intentional when improving your personal and professional life — life itself is inspiration.
- Read things that make it hard to keep your mouth shut. You should feel compelled to take notes and talk about it with those select few people that “get you” (your eventual audience).
- It doesn’t matter what you are consuming, as long as you are curious. Pursue your curiosity.
- A tip to break from analysis paralysis is to consume the information related to the principles, mentors, or sub-topics of your interests inside the Domain Of Mastery.
## Implement
- Once you have an idea you want to dissect, the next steps are:
	- Write down the idea
	- Add a reference: note where you got it from.
	- **Remix**: summarizing it in your own words. How would you make sense of the idea? How does it make sense to you at your current stage of development? That is how it will make sense to the people you can help.
	- Expand: write out common problems, objections, benefits, metaphors, and personal experiences to set yourself up for great content for that idea. (You will be doing this when you write long-form anyway).
- The final step is to summarize everything you've written to a single sentence, then craft it in a way that provokes curiosity to make it your headline.
# Build an audience
- Your writing output should have clarity and confidence on:
	- **[[Writing#Who |Who]]** you are writing to
	- **[[Writing#What |What]]** problems they have
	- **[[Writing#How |How]]** you can help solve them
	- **[[Writing#Why |Why]]** they should listen
- If you are interested in something, other people are. You aren’t that special.
- We are aiming for building a large audience here, and you don’t want to put yourself in a box too soon. You want to give yourself ample room in terms of writing and audience growth.
- _Try **not** to_ attract an audience of trolls. You feel like you’re making progress attracting haters, but as soon as you sell something, they will do what they're best at: tanking your business. You don’t want that audience.  
- Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward.
- Once you have your 3 interests that you plan to master, you can write about anything related to those interests.
- The “why” is your greatest tool in all of your content. This is what sets you apart and is how you display your unique perspective/philosophy on the topic at hand.
- As a beginner, you should not be focused on anything else unless it involves practicing getting results for a free client.
- Build an audience of up to 2500 followers on all platforms then start releasing free products. ==Leverage your existing audience to get referrals== to your [[#Email list]].
- Your content over a 6-12 month timeframe is what determines your followers' perception of you.
- Analyze and resolve issues from customers' [[Entrepreneurship#Feedback |feedback]] on the free products to create [[#Monetize your products |paid]] products.  
- The more consistent you are, the more people you attract, and the more people trust you enough to invest in your product.
- ==Formulate your content according to the ***List Format***==. Lists and numbers make people stop and read. Each paragraph ([[#Medium form |medium]] - [[#Long form |long]] form) or sentence ([[#Short form]]) should clearly announce a key takeaway point.
## Criteria
### Who
- You are writing to your past, present, and future ***self***. That "self" is your audience.
- Be unique, attract a tribe of like-minded people, and help the community of people you can help the most.
- Treat your writing as a public journal. Those are the tips, tricks, realizations, and advice/direction to a version of yourself:
	- Give your past self advice on traps to avoid
	- Give your present self advice on what you should be doing to see success
	- Give yourself motivation and inspiration from the lens of your future self that has already accomplished those things
- The secret is to write it as if you are speaking to another person, or you are speaking to yourself in third person.
### What
- The problems you are solving with your content and writing are **your problems.**
- With a personal brand, you are attracting people that vibe with your message, interests, and expertise (while still [[Entrepreneurship#The ingredients|persuading]] them that those things are important in terms of their quality of life).
### How
- Tell your *story* with some [[Entrepreneurship#Authenticity |authenticity]].
- Knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your hobbies, oddly enough. 
- If you have hobbies around your intellectual curiosity, you’re more likely to develop these passions.
- Your lifestyle is ***unique***. Pivot your experiences around ***how*** your pursue of interests will improve their life.
- Get creative. Make the process feel like play and/or experiment. People love to play, whether they admit it or not. You create a game-like mechanism by wrapping everything up into a clear, concise, and actionable way of getting a specific result — and making it clear on what they should do next. Remember that most of your audience are beginners. Being able to play reduces the friction towards any goal.
### Why
- Your life experiences are the “why” behind your interests. The pains, benefits, and range of emotions associated with your lifestyle.
- You're delivering a tangible promise: providing an _exact_ list of [[Entrepreneurship#The values |benefits]] customers will get from your product or service. Essentially, you’re offering a solution tailored to their *specific* need.
### Structure
- These days people have short attention span. This is the recommended structure to cope with that:
	- **Bullet lists** — use numbers, bullets, and other tactics that help you break apart what you are saying. These lists create a “story” in themselves.
	- **Line breaks** — use line breaks whenever possible, but don’t just add line breaks for the sake of it. Be creative. Use line breaks to emphasize specific sentences and help your writing flow.
	- **Starting short and concise** — Use shorter sentences or paragraphs at the start of your content. Capture attention with short and punchy statements, then let loose and get creative with how your sentences flow.
	- **Break apart sentences** — use parenthesis and “—” dashes over commas. This sentence is too long (until I make people want to know what are in these parenthesis).
- A unit of content in [[#Short form |short]] and [[#Medium form |medium]] form shouldn't be longer than 5 lines.
#### Content ideas
- If you don't know what to write about, here are some clues:
	- **Commentary On Objections Or Advice**: it's your inner dialogue. Your unspoken words about some topics.
	- **“Extreme” Advice**: transfer the enthusiasm by using action-driven words. List out the steps (ideally less than 10).
	- **Metaphors**: tap into the hidden meaning behind events and patterns in your daily life.
	- **Personal Definitions**: basically your unique perception on common things. Your "unconventional" approach. This requires you to be observant about how you go about your days.
	- **Raise Awareness**: something that an average person is not paying enough attention to.
	- **Repetitive Advice & Comparisons**: start with a one-sentence piece of advice and brainstorm different variations of that sentence. Think of your posts like a journal where you give high-engaging advice to yourself (but positioned at others).
	- **Pathway**: one thing comes after the next. Write down one word, what it leads to, and what comes next — then refine and edit. For example: "this" after "that", "then" after "if", "You can do this… But you have to..."
	- **Wake up call**: harsh truths in general always work well. You can add a hook to the top that describes or warns about the advice you are going to give.
	- **Tips and tricks**: something you tried that worked.
	- **Identity**: describe the traits of yourself or the community you are in. Or just give a *controversial* opinion on a characterized group.
	- **Polarity**: thinking in pair of extremes. What is the best, greatest, worst, most terrible thing someone can do?
- Or just pick a problem, and write about it with [[#Product category |these qualifications]] in mind.
## Leverages
- Here are some leads which can help you scale your audience:
	- **Engaging with big accounts**: respond to accounts with a large following 10-20 times per day with _your personal experience relating to the topic they posted about._ **Do not** reply by rewording what they said. Remember — pains, benefits, and transformations for a specific awareness level — that is what will make people follow you.
	- **Networking with people you *want* to work with**: send 3-5 DMs per day complimenting someone you want to work with on a recent post of theirs. Follow up with them in a few days with content that you wrote using theirs as inspiration. DM it to them and tell them that they inspired what you wrote (many times they will engage with it, boosting the amount of impressions it gets).
	- ==**The BIGGEST growth lever in business is customer retention and referrals**==: [[Entrepreneurship#Free advertising |Happy customers]] are more likely to spend more cash and buy your new products or services. The longer you retain customers, the more opportunity you have to earn more revenue from them.
	- **Writing beginner-friendly educational content**: we need a balance of growth and authority. Target a very beginner level (and low level of awareness) problem and educated people on how to overcome it. List style posts (bullet point steps) work the best in this scenario. Then turn each of the bullet points into their own post.
	- **Boosting traffic through curation**: write a thread or a post and mention large accounts in it (they may engage with it). If you write a thread about fitness and go over a talking point that a large account talks about, recommend people to follow that account.
	- **Immerse yourself in a conducive growth environment**: for the next 30 days, follow the people you aspire to be like and comment on their posts. Watch YouTube videos and only expose yourself to an echo chamber of content that you would want to create. Listen to audiobooks and podcasts on the topics you want to talk about. Read a book this month on something that you _may_ want to be known for. This alone will fill your mind with ideas on how to grow and write.
> ==What makes your work go viral? **Emotions**.== 
> Put yourself in the shoes of your audience. What makes you share a specific post/tweet? 
> You **heavily agreed** on what that post delivered. It makes you feel/look a little "better" by sharing it. It raises your perceived social status. 
## Content length
 - A recommended flow to funnel your audience to your products looks like:
 > Social media (short & medium form) → newsletter (long form) → landing page → profit
 > They all serve their unique purpose but also interconnect.
- Think of your social media as the first layer of your business. Your salesman. Your newsletter/email list is where you gradually build trust in your brand.
- ==Remember to put your newsletter subscription at the top and/or bottom of your content.== Always try to remove the friction to turn a visitor into a subscriber, then eventually, into [[Entrepreneurship#Lead magnet |a customer]]. 
- Focus on growing on one platform — in this case, Twitter is a good place to start, because it has the most powerful share feature of all platforms. Easy to go viral, especially in written format. A good leverage to approach other platforms.
- ==The headline, the first item in the carousel ***must*** capture attention.== 
> Medium and long form should follow the AIDA (**A**ttention - **I**nterest - **D**esire - **A**ction) and/or and PPP (**P**ull, **P**erspective, **P**unchline) structure (for each sub-topic or as a whole article).
- It's easier to start with a long form, then condense your key ideas (actionable parts) into medium and short forms. 
	- You can also do it the other way around, it doesn't matter which form you start with, as varying content lengths cater effectively to different topics.
	- In short and medium form, you can add a comment with a link to read the long form or download the [[Entrepreneurship#Lead magnet |lead magnet]].
### Short form
- Time for consumption is around 30s to 5 minutes. 
- Short-form - short attention span. No retention. They're hooks for enticing a new audience. The purpose is to spark their interest and curiosity. People never buy things straight off of a short-form post.
- Your job is to [[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |convert]] your audience to the point where they become your customer. Take advantage of controversial topics and quotes.
- A quote is like packaging up 10 years of experience in one sentence. They have _depth_ behind them.
- Try not to embed links in the.
- You can also test new ideas and monitor your audience's engagement:
	- Tweets
	- IG posts & stories
	- Reels & TikToks
	- Shorter LinkedIn posts
- The inspiration for this type of content is distilled from the key takeaways of [[#Medium form]] posts. This is mostly about engagement, helping you draw them deeper into your work.
- If a short performs well, you can plug your [[#Long form]] as a reply to that short.
### Medium form
- Time for consumption is around 5 to 15 minutes. 
- Recommended to start on LinkedIn since it has a character limit. Perfect length for medium form.
- The inspiration for this type of content can be derived from its corresponding long form or from your [[#Learn from others |conscious consumption]].
- Medium-form is a mixture of depth and rapid growth, attracting a broad spectrum of people that have similar interests as you by giving your unique perspective on a [particular topic](https://x.com/FitFounder/status/1800558829731500518):
	- Threads: you should be able to post ***every*** tweet in the thread as a standalone tweet (so that it's easier to retweet and bring in more audience). Or chain the thread with cliffhangers if you're telling a story. The [[#Engagement |first tweet]] of your thread is the most important.
	- Carousels (use Canva or Figma for this)
	- Instagram captions
	- Full-length LinkedIn posts
	- Clipped videos
- Use those to encourage them to dive into your long-form content, and from there you can sell your products or services without seeming like a timeline spammer or “overly salesy.” Our goal is to send as much traffic as we can to our [[#Long form]].
- Threads lead to more followers because you are holding attention longer. You are building trust and giving people more of a reason to follow you. A viral thread can pull in 500-5,000+ followers and bring new opportunities to your DMs.
- AI Prompt example:
	- "I am a productivity coach who posts content online to help my audience work more efficiently and have better mental performance. Please generate *10* compelling ideas for ***listicle-style** articles* that have *viral potential*."

> [!note]- Tagging big accounts
> - The creators tagged in the thread understand that if they engage with the post, they will probably get quite a few followers from it too.
> - You can also do this on Instagram by putting all of the posts in a carousel and tagging the accounts in the image itself – they may share it to their story. For bonus effect, you can tag them all in a list in the caption.
> - If your thread/tweet in a thread somehow increase the [[Entrepreneurship#Social leverage |social leverage]] of big accounts (by tagging them), there's a chance they'll share it to boost your exposure. 
> - You can do this by summarize what you've learned from their tweets (add a touch of your uniqueness if possible), and tag them at the end of your thread. 
- All medium-form content should have a call to action (e.g. ask people to RT, follow) at the bottom. Either a [[#Long form |link to your newsletter]] — or directions telling them where to find that newsletter (because you can’t post links in places like an Instagram caption). 
### Long form
- Time for consumption is around 20 to 90 minutes. 
- The ideal frequency for publishing is once a week.
- Long-form emphasizes depth and [[Entrepreneurship#Authority |authority]]. Long-form content sells more. It's just the truth. ==This is where you audience turns into customers==:
	- ==Newsletters, articles (i.e. blog)==
	- Podcasts
	- YouTube videos
	- A book (when and if you want to)
- Most social media content is broad, beginner-level, and meant for quick entertainment. Few people will actually buy products straight from social media. 
- Social media platforms owns the algorithm, your data, and anything you post. It's centralized and your brand is at their mercy. 
- Your newsletter is the least friction path for you to detach from the dependency on algorithms and direct your followers to an email list for your paid products, giving you full ownership of your audience. Refer to your own newsletter subscriptions. Pick out the format that you love. Copy that.
- Send a weekly newsletter expanding on your [[#Filter out your top performers |best]] social media posts.
- ==Construct your content so that it's easy to extract the key takeaways== (e.g. craft your headers in a way that spark the reader's interest and guide their anticipation further down the post, eventually, to your products).
- Once you've got a good number of audiences (thousands) in the list, you should focus on:
	- **Customer creation**: educate your audience to the point of becoming customers for your other products.
	- **Writing what you want**: all of your authoritative information on one subject is in one place. You don’t have to worry about writing so much about it on social media. Social media now serves as hooks to your newsletter.
	- **Selling your product**: give people [[Entrepreneurship#The values |enough information]] to trust in buying your product. ==This is where you slowly put your upcoming products into their subconscious minds==. You should plug it toward the end of your lead magnet to make sales when the “leads” (free products) are hot.
- All long-form content should have a call to action to purchase your product (with other newsletter issues and products linked throughout the newsletter). Use [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com) or [Substack](https://substack.com) as your CMS. 
#### Email list
- The only way to consistently monetize whatever audience you build, wherever you build it, is with email. 
	- That means that you’re not really “building an audience” if you don’t have their email.
	- No matter how many new social media platforms pop up, email is still the most powerful channel for deepening your relationship with your audience.
- It’s about quality, not quantity. A healthy email list has a ==20 percent open rate==. Target that.
- Everyone in your audience matters forever, but _especially at the beginning_, you should respond to every single new subscriber.
- ==Set up an autoresponder== and hit them up _right away_ (when they sign up) with your _**best**_ [[Entrepreneurship#Lead magnet |content]]. Use the existing [[#Copywriting |tools]] to help you with that. Here's the recommended sign up email sequence (or you can combine them all to one email):
	1. Welcome email: "Thanks for joining `[my newsletter]`. ==_What could I write to provide value to you?_==". Or you can give them a form to fill out what they need most help with, so you can tailor your content and products accordingly.
	2. Connection email: "Send me a connection request on LinkedIn, follow me on Twitter,..."
	3. Content email: give them your [[Entrepreneurship#Lead magnet |lead magnet]]. 
- An example for a cold invite to join your email list:
	 _Hey `[name]`!
	 I just wanted to let you know that I’m starting `[description of your new business]`.
	 I’m going to publish `[one article per week/a weekly ACTIONABLE tip]` on how to `[subject]`. No spam ever, I promise :))
	 If this something you're interested in, here’s an easy way to sign up! `[Insert landing page address]` 
	 Or you can just simply write back with 1 word “Yes” and I’ll do it for you!
	 Hope things are great!
	 `[Your name]`_
- When you add your landing page to your email and your social bios, you can measure the traffic and conversion rate you get from these mentions with [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) or [Linktree](https://linktr.ee), website address shorteners that track clicks.  
#### Newsletter
 - This is where you build your uniqueness and authority along with a **diehard fan base**:
##### The headline
 - ==The headline is the most important part of all==. If you fail to _**capture**_ [[#Confidence & Conviction |attention]] with the headline, consider that post didn't exist. The headline is all about distilling your entire post into a single sentence, therefore, _do **not**_ write your hook or headline until you have written the entire post. Make it impactful & worthwhile. Here's how to create a good hook:
	- **Relevance** — how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What’s in it for the reader?
	- **Awareness** — is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?
	- **Effort + timeframe** — *how fast* will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?
	- **The BIG problem** — you can create this by summarizing all of the problems you have listed.
	- **The BIG benefit** — again, you can create this by summarizing all of the benefits into one.
	- **The BIG idea** — can you summarize the most impactful parts of the post into one sentence?
	- **The transformation process** — you can use numbers or a unique name to hint at the process that will get them results (posing an information gap).
	- **Negative personal experience** — if you include a personal experience in your content, can you imply a low point during that experience and the emotion associated with it?
- People want to feel understood. You don’t need to solve everything yet. If they feel understood, they are more open to hearing what you have to say.
##### The body
 - Right after the headline is where you start to ***hold*** *attention* (make them wonder "what's next"). Several ways to get that retention:
	 - **Personal experiences or anecdotes**: this is what they can relate the most with. Empathy and compassion never fail.
	 - **A _[[#Active voice |story]]_ that illustrates the problem we are going to solve**: always start by hinting at a problem. People's beliefs are more durably impacted by stories than by statistics. ==Articulate your story so that your audience (_**not**_ you) *feels* like they're solving the problem as they proceed with the reading. Make it *immersive*.==
	 - **A common piece of advice or perspective that we will disprove and give better advice for**: your "better" advice is formulated by **[[Entrepreneurship#Authenticity |your]]** unique life experience and circumstances.
	 - **A big idea that we will break down, dissect, and make practical**: clarify what the problem is about and the other problems that stem from it, what can you do about it.
 - The header is a high-impact text placed at the start of a subtopic to entice the reader where ==**[visualization](https://excalidraw.com/)** (charts, diagram, maps,...) or a one-liner is placed at the end for summarizing/consolidating what you've just discussed==. 
 - Make the experience of reading your work similar to listening to music: combine various sentence/paragraph length. ==Weave emotion into your words. Bring flow-like experience. Strong emotions create lasting memories.==
##### Context
 - You must set the stage for them to implement your advice with good reasoning behind it.
 - Quotes can serve as a transition point between subtopics.
 - It's an art to make every subtopic stand out on its own while also ensuring that all the subtopics flow together coherently to form a complete piece.

## Engagement
- If you get someone’s attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to their self-interest.
- Your job is to capture attention, hold attention, and deliver value to that attention throughout all of your writing.
> The most influential ideas are not the most intelligent ones but the most mediocre. Something that is easily resonates with everyone.
- Give people what they want in a way they're not expecting. You're trying to ==evoke their emotional response. Make it relatable==. Once the curiosity loop is opened, the mind feels committed to figuring out the rest of the story. 
- If you can take people on an emotional ride of love, hate, excitement, deceit, peaceful, offended, and any other emotion that eventually ends in a benefit for their life — you have mastered the art of content creation.
	- Stories are layers of metaphors, concepts, perspectives, comparisons and experiences that take people on a journey. You present a problem and guide someone to overcome it. Craft a compelling - intriguing **[[#Active voice |story]]** is the way to go.
- ***Controversy*** is an under-utilized factor. ==Framing your content to spark debate== is highly effective, as long as it avoids being extremely offensive (e.g. topics like religion or core values should be approached with careful consideration). **Use this as a way to *build a deeper connection* with your audience.** 
- Getting your audience involved helps them feel like an integral part of the show, which boosts the chances they’ll engage with your content, which pushes it up the rankings, and attracts even more subscribers.
- The people you want to *attract* aren’t the people that “hate” on your work. Be cautious of this as it can destroy your authority in the market. There will always be haters, and your job is not to eliminate them, but rather not to attract them.
- Start with 2-3 tweets a day, [[Entrepreneurship#Tactics |engage]] with your audience 10-20 times a day.
> Pivot your engagement around emotions, curiosity, entertainment, education, and inspiration.
- Use these methods to capture your audience's attention:
### Numbers
- The more specific the number is, the more it catches peoples attention. Numbers can be in the form of statistics, amount of money, metrics, lists,...
### Loop breakers
- A good punch line, a bold statement, a "change my mind", a one-liner... things that make a consumer stop for second.
- Sometimes all you need is an aesthetically formatted, good quote. Beauty attracts. 
### Negativity bias
- Deliver positive messages while leveraging the reader’s negativity bias:
	- “*You are going to achieve great things.*” → “*You will never hit rock bottom again*.”
- Focus on what comes after the word "but": 
	- "_Out program is really long & complex, **BUT**, it works every time._"
### Group Call out
- Even if your audience doesn’t fall into the specific group you are calling out, it will allow them to “pick a side” and compare themselves to what you are saying.
- Call out your audience's ***identity***, make them feel *relatable*, or make them feel conscious about their behaviors:
	- "If you are in your 20’s…"
	- "Parents, I know this is hard..."
- You can call out exactly who the promotion is for and paint a picture of the problems they are struggling with.
### Problem - Solution Call out
- Bring their pain, frustration, inconvenience, complaints, performance gaps,...into words (make them can't be unseen), and briefly talk about the cause:
	- "*You're suffering because your subconscious mind knows that you're supposed to be better than this.*"
	- "*A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.*"
- Implicitly/explicitly attach a possible solution with a problem call out:
	- "*Perfectionism is procrastination masquerading as quality control.*"
	- "*No amount of anxiety makes any difference to anything that is going to happen.*"
### Social proof
- When you flex your results or credentials, people automatically assume that you know more than them. 
- Truth: Your flex works best when it isn’t viewed as a “flex.”
- Once you're in [[Entrepreneurship#Promotions |promotion]], your full time job to collect testimonials and social proof from your audience. 
- To get testimonials, you can DM people within your direct network. In the creator economy, this usually means creators that are in [[Entrepreneurship#Build your tribe |your tribe]].
	- The beautiful thing about testimonials from creators is that they are appreciating assets. As their popularity increases, so does the value of their testimonial.
- You can create a "post your wins" space inside of Circle, Discord, Telegram, or whatever other platform you use.
- This is both where customers can give you praise and where other students can gain inspiration to attempt to get more results. 
	- When people post their wins, you can screenshot those and save them as testimonials, and other customers can use them as motivation to use your product to its maximum potential.
- Whether you have a cohort, course, or community it is wise to create a testimonial automation by:
	- Creating a free bonus that you will send to people who leave testimonials.
	- Adding a module to the end of your product asking people to submit a testimonial in exchange for the free bonus.
	- Automating or manually sending out an email after the cohort ends or after people have been in the course/community for enough time to get results.
- Connect your [testimonials](https://testimonial.to) to your email marketing software like [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) and add them to an automated email. In that email sequence you include a link to the video, document, template (or anything that's your "free bonus") that they can download. Or use [zapier](https://zapier.com) to unlock the bonuses after they submitted a testimonial.
- From there, you can embed the testimonials onto your landing page to enhance the sales for your next launch.
### Confidence & Conviction
- Everyone is on social media to be told what to do in a confident way. Nobody is secure in their actions, choices, and beliefs. They are looking for someone to confirm them with confidence and give them that clarity to act.
- Just by crafting your words to be more bold and assertive, you'll be able to gain people's trust: 
	- Eliminate words that imply uncertainty
	- Speak in absolutes when possible
	- Exaggerate your point to add energy
- _Do **not** abuse_ these for the sake of engagement:
	- _“It may be wise if some people developed their skillset.”_  → _“It is crucial that everyone develops their skillset.”_
### Active voice
 - Imply a good story. Build anticipation. Anticipate the process so that the end makes sense. Make people *want to* figure out what happened next *without* skipping to the end. Like a MrBeast video. 
 - This also helps with being perceived as [[#Confidence & Conviction |confident]].
### Cautionary statements
 - What should people look out for when they are trying to achieve something?
 - When you are doing your weekly reflection, or just reflecting on your life, write down the roadblocks and redirection that helped you navigate.

# Monetize your products
- Once you built an audience (at around 10K+ followers), it's time to sell your products. _**Digital** products_. Those are courses, templates, trackers, software,...Something you built once, then sell forever.
- Social media posts aren't the ones that directly generate income. Use them as leverage to funnel your audience to those actual products that you're selling. Write posts, write scripts for videos, then ultimately, write the content for your products. 
- Continuously launching, improving, and iterating until you have the perfect combination of digital products that create a desired high base income (where its minimum is equal to 6 months of your living fixed costs).
- If you don’t make more than you spend, it's:
	- Your system isn't targeting a demand. 
	- Your product/service isn’t broad or good enough. It should feel like a "*must-have*" rather than a "nice-to-have".
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Marketing |marketing]] needs more volume. 
> You need people to buy your product in order to get results → be able to improve the product → become an expert yourself.
> Research and look into what's already selling well in the market, extract their essences (especially their hook & packaging) for your products.

> [!info] The process
> When you have your product stack built out, your main focuses are:
> - Growing an audience with [[Entrepreneurship#Problems and solutions |broad attractive]] content.
> - Nurturing that audience with lead magnets and weekly emails (while promoting your products inside)
> - Launching cohorts, courses, community, price increases, or special offers every 2-3 months to your email list and on social media.
## Market research
> [!important] Verify the need
> Have a look at the keywords of your products via Facebook Ads to verify the market's demand and see how many units you need to sell to reach your desired profit goal.
### Filter out your top performers
- Things to write about:
	- Your extreme beliefs (like "nobody should drink alcohol"). You should provide a good argument as to why to change people's minds. Spark controversy. Controversy brings engagement to your post. Which is always a good thing.
	- “Damn I wish I wrote that” ideas from people you love reading and following. Remix them, turn them into your own.
	- Problems people face relating to your topics or interests.
	- Arguments to content you read. After you read a post you disagree with, write your own post arguing the other side.
	- Personal opinions on popular topics.
	- Interesting facts about any topic (for this, you'll have to consciously consume your entertainment).
	- Your take on top performing/controversial content.
	- Lessons you are learning on your journey.
	- Advice to your past, present, or future self.
	- Harsh truths about achieving a goal.
	- Aspirational advice (telling people what to do and why they should do it).
	- Anything you want (as long as you hit on “What can I learn from this?").
- The more topics you write about, the more you understand what you should double down on.
- As you write content, pay close attention to which ideas perform the best each month.
	- If you repurpose good posts into threads and newsletters, and all of those do well, you may have a winner.
- You can use any of those as a starting point for a lead magnet (to further expand the pool of your audience) or a new product. 
> Analyze and pick out a specific post time where your posts have the most engagement.
- When you hit the right idea, capitalize on it, *fast*, when your name is still fresh in their minds.
### Refine your high-performers
- _**Consciously** consume_ the content related to your high-performing topics and take notes on those that resonate well with you. Only consume what you’d like to become.
- Filter by popularity to pick up the hook, the thumbnail, the structure,... anything that makes their video/post went viral (by noticing your own reaction), note that down and try to imitate them.
> Recycle them after a certain batch of new followers to keep them hooked.
### Engage with your audience
- Reply and/or react to their comments. As you interact with others over the course of weeks/months, note down common questions that people ask and the problems associated with them. Improve your products.
> [!important]- Keep your audience engaged
> It's important that you KEEP the audience that follows you. Keep your name in their subconscious mind.
> They probably won’t buy from you immediately, but may 3-6 months or years down the road from your content, lead magnet, or newsletter. Nothing happens then everything happens.
- Once you have an audience over 2500 followers, you can test asking a question/voting for an idea in the form of a post.
- If they mention something relevant to the product you want to create, ask them if you can test your product on them to help them achieve their goals.
- Notice those followers who regularly engage, give them something free as a treat. See if you can help them in your area of expertise. Test your ideas and products on them before going big.
### Learn from others
- Be a _**conscious** consumer_ of your inspiring creators. _**Learn**_ their system. Join their email lists, read their blogs, watch their viral content, study their product landing pages, and *buy their courses* to get new ideas for your own. Make your product a remix of theirs.
- Learning is problem-solving, not hoarding as much knowledge as you can.
- Always have this question in your mind: "What's so good about this? How can it be better?"

## Idea validation
- This is how you see if your product is gonna make millions:
> Find _**three**_ customers in **_forty-eight_** hours who will give you **_money_** for your idea.
- To do that:
### Direct preselling
- Make real contact with real people, tell them what I’m selling, ask for money, and see how they react.
- Validation is a conversation. Not a sales pitch, but a chat to learn about the customer, see *how* you can help them and if they’ll actually pay you.
- Use what or how questions to encourage a more open dialogue versus why or yes/no questions, which can limit your learning.
### Marketplace
- Use tools like Facebook Marketplace (or whatever pop social media platform in your area) 
- Don’t overthink the design, the name, the language, the ads, or any of that. Just focus on good [[#Copywriting]] and see if you can get people to buy your product.

## Product category
- Sell what's already selling. If someone isn’t selling it, you probably won’t succeed with your first product.
> Again, to sell a product, you must [[Writing#Learn from others |know how]] a product is sold.
- To increase the desire and effectiveness of your product, have them track their progress.
- Your products should include these qualifications: 
	- **Anti-vision**: how their lives are getting worse without the solutions that your product offers
	- **Vision**: what could be better
	- **Goal**: what to aim for
	- **Project**: how to get there
	- **Education**: the right mindset
	- **Levers**: habits to instill
- Most of these categories (except [[#Cohorts]]) require you to continuously market it in order to sustain sales.
### Tutorials
- This works best for teaching a skill (in form of a course) like:
	- Web design or development
	- Graphic design or animation
	- Custom car builds or another hobby
	- Video editing or photography
- People will only buy from you if you are [[Entrepreneurship#The ingredients |persuasive]] as to how your interest or skill can benefit their life. You market *the importance* of a topic in your content and marketing, people **become** more interested in buying:
	- Web design is a high-value skill to add to your career.
	- Web design is a way to start freelancing in minimal time so you can replace your income.
	- Web design is how you create a website and landing page for your own business.
- Once you've nailed the persuasion, you will be the *only one* that provides them a solution to learn that skill because you are top of their mind.
- Base the curriculum around building out a project (like a website for web design or edited video for videography).
### Programs - courses
- This works best for interests (especially if they require discipline) like:
	- Fitness
	- Nutrition
	- Productivity or performance
	- Self-improvement
- Give them a step-by-step action plan (a regimen) to achieve a desirable end result.
- Use [kartra](https://kartra.com/) or [gumroad](https://gumroad.com) to structure your course.
- Have them track their metrics in a template or spreadsheet you create (like their daily calories, weight, and lifts in the gym).
	- Design your courses in a way that gives your customer a clear answer to "_How can I design a life, month, week, and day with this new habit that gives me a sense of control over my life?_"
- If you have a cohort and a course, solely focus on course sales in between cohort launches.
### Cohorts
- A cohort is a subscription-based course with a specific start date and a *limited* number of students where you host weekly live streams to guide that group of students (think of it as one-to-many consulting instead of 1:1). 
- Scarcity is baked in for this type of product.
- It has some form of communication feature like a group chat (Discord, Telegram,...) and live calls that people can join for Q&A (Zoom, Google Meat,...) or specific education relating to the curriculum. You can usually charge more for this compared to a typical course.
	- You can also get testimonials easier because you have helped them on a deeper level just by how cohorts are structured.
	- Rotate and iterate between cohorts and standalone courses: take a valuable part of your cohort and turn it into a lower-priced course. Leverage the testimonials and results you've gotten to sell to a larger audience. Upsell your course buyers to the cohort to increase sales.
	- Use [Circle](https://circle.so) if your wallet is thick enough. Or just [gumroad](https://gumroad.com) instead. 
	- Once the cohort starts, release your curriculum every week or evert other week so that you can track and keep them on the same page.
- You can leverage scarcity and relaunch the cohort as much as you'd like, creating a predictable income stream.
### Live events/workshops
- Use this to sustain/boost your income in between the [[Entrepreneurship#Promotions |2-3 months]] launch cycles. The content for this should be short, focused and impactful; solving a specific pain point:
	- Pick a high-value topic that is already selling.
	- Create a short landing page around that topic.
	- Set a date for the workshop, training, or event. Leverage this date as scarcity for people to enroll before that date.
	- Promote it for 1 week on your email list and social accounts.
	- Charge $49 to $150 for each access.
	- Record the workshop, training, or event so customers have access after the live call.
	- Repeat every 1-2 months to generate predictable revenue.
	- Alternate between different topics if you want to.
### Systems/communities
- This works best for unique systems you’ve built, usually it's the combination of all the above, requires trial and error to build a system that works for you:
	- Building a social media audience
	- Lead generation for businesses
	- Productivity systems ==in ***Notion***==
- Recommended steps for building a system:
	1. **List out steps people need to take to achieve your *clear* goal**: they need to be effective.
	2. **Test those steps inside of Notion or just with pen and paper**.
	3. **Content in video format**: prioritize video instructions over other formats.
	4. **Give this path/process a compelling name**: once you have the steps mapped out, the name will come easier. Write down 5 or so names - let it sit for a few days - and come back to it.
	5. **The outcome**: have your customer build out their version of the necessary components of the system itself.
- Systems should be sold at $225 ~ $1000. Sell systems after you've had good [[Entrepreneurship#Social leverage |social leverage]].

## Copywriting
- Copywriting is how you effectively communicate your marketing strategy on a ***[landing page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT6lOFtkw_6ucZbUQujJPsCCodiMmVHIrw2grKrv8hlO6K9j57UWRKUeRynPLeA8lWOAcMgi11cDGwO/pub)***.
- In-depth copywriting is there to push people that aren’t already going to buy over the edge by clearing their doubts.
- The depth of your content, quality of the product, quantity of promotions, and amount of social proof will do most of the heavy lifting.
- Tools to build a [landing page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTdtSVW3YuOTArahgeJTGzVfMlNA5TSdJLl2YyCADJh6bPsrJxCp4INeDPAoT7EKrS6Plzb8MC8ifDb/pub):  
	- [SendFox](https://sendfox.com)
	- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com)
	- [WebFlow](https://webflow.com)
	- [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com)
	- Or build your own with code
- The ultimate goal of this page/site is to trigger an impulsive buy without being blatant about it. 
	- For example, offer a limited-time discount for certain type of customer or time of the year.
### The structure
- Follow [this demo](https://cc.kortex.co), from top to bottom:
	- **The callout**: the very first line - capture attention and open a curiosity loop.
	- **The headline**: the big **bold** line, the *most important* part of the page - your *main* qualifying pain point, the "[[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |aha]]" trigger.
	- **The sub-headline**: a risk-reversal assurance, or a hint at your _**unique** mechanism_. 
		- "_I help `[targeted customers]` get `[desires]` without `[the painful trade-offs]` through `[my unique mechanism]`._"
	- **[[#Social proof]]**: works best if you have a good [[Entrepreneurship#Networking |community]] where you can send a free trial of your product to get their *good* reviews.
	- **Lead**: a bullet point list of 5-6 qualifying pain points, unfulfilled ***needs*** (usually the lack of clarity to achieve something that your product will offer, or something they wouldn't want to become, i.e. the *anti-vision*). Have some context around them, make them feel personal & special. Give them reasons to continue reading to find out what **the** solution could be (your unique mechanism).  
	- **Transformation & Mechanism**: your job is to _give away **just enough**_ of what the product delivers to _make them **want more**_. Like a free demo for an upcoming game. A Teaser. Keep it short and simple.
	- **Offer Introduction**: a curriculum of your product. Highlighting _**why**_ they should care about it. Answers to the "lead" above:
		- "_`[A solution]` ==so that== (or ==so you can==) solve `[the pain point]`_."
		- "_For `[a price]`, I will teach you how to `[achieve a desire]` in `[timeframe]`._"
	- **More social proof**: tweets and screenshots of good reviews on your product. If you are just starting out you need to make it your full time job to get social proof. 
	- **[[Entrepreneurship#Guaranty |Risk Reversal]]**: cancel anytime or next round for free (if it's a subscription), refund,...
	- **Call To Action**: remind them of a few of their pain points, then remind them of where they could be with your solution.
	- **FAQ**: reread what you've just laid out, pretend to be a customer and see if you're having any questions. Gather opinions from your trial users.

- None of these would work until you actually promote the page. Then, analyze and tailor to the market.
