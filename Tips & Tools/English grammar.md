# Tenses
- Future tenses: must include a *specific* point of time in the future, except for Future Simple:
	- **Future Simple**: for decisions made at the moment of speaking or for (uncertain) future actions/events, e.g. _"She will walk to school tomorrow."_
	- **Future Continuous**: for actions that *will be ==in progress==* at a specific future time, e.g. _"She will be **walking** to school **at 8 AM**."_
	- **Future Perfect**: for actions that _will be ==completed before==_ a certain future time, e.g. "_She will **have walked** to school **by 9 AM**._"
	- **Future Perfect Continuous**: for actions that _will be ==ongoing (**duration**) until==_ a certain point in the future, e.g. "_She will **have been walking** to school **for 30 minutes** by 10 AM._"
