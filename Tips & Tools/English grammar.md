# Tenses
- Future tenses: must include a *specific* point of time in the future, except for Future Simple:
	- **Future Simple**: for decisions made at the moment of speaking or for (uncertain) future actions/events, e.g. _"She will walk to school tomorrow."_
	- **Future Continuous**: for actions that *will be ==in progress==* at a specific future time, e.g. _"She will be **walking** to school **at 8 AM**."_
	- **Future Perfect**: for actions that _will be ==completed before==_ a certain future time, e.g. "_She will **have walked** to school **by 9 AM**._"
	- **Future Perfect Continuous**: for actions that _will be ==ongoing (**duration**) until==_ a certain point in the future, e.g. "_She will **have been walking** to school **for 30 minutes** by 10 AM._"

- **Primitive verb**:
	- After modal verbs: **can** run, **should** eat, **must** sleep, **might** work, **may** seem, **ought to** try...
	- After subjunctive (describing possibilities, hypothetical situations, formal requests and commands). For example: 
		- It is **important** that he **be** on time.
		- It is **essential** that we **finish** this project by Friday.
		- It was **suggested** that they **perform** well".

	- After "let - help - make":
		- The teacher **made** him **write** the essay.
		- They **let** us **leave** the party.
		- She **helped** me **fix** the car.
	- After suggestive expressions: had better, would rather, would sooner. For example:
		- You had better **go** now.
		- I would rather **stay** home.
		- She would sooner **die** than **admit** she was wrong.
- The word "shall" is only used for informal/personal *suggestions* ("Shall we go to...") but *not* for the future tense.
	- The negative "shan’t" or "shall not" is almost never used in modern English today.
- **Modal verbs**: only one should be used, for example:
	- ~~might can~~ → might be able to
	- ~~should must~~ → `must` or `should`
	- ~~does might~~ → might
- **Auxiliary collocations**: Do/Does/Did must ***not*** be collocated with modal verbs.
- "**Any**" can come before both plural and singular nouns. With singular nouns, it be replaced with "a" or "an" for _countable_ singular nouns:
	- ~~Is there any apple in the fridge?~~ → _Is there `an` apple in the fridge?_
	- _Is there `any` coffee left?_ ("coffee" is an _uncountable_ singular noun)
