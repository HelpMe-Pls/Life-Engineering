> [!info]- What I've learnt from taking this test
> - Critical thinking and how to come up with good questions. (Writing Task 2)
> - Skill issue: communication (and I mean speaking as a skill, in your own native language, not just English).
> - Practically speaking, you're only as good as how you present yourself. **_Perceived_** value precedes actual value, whether you like it or not. Harsh truth, but that's just how the world works. The fastest way to raise your perceived value is through better articulation. 
> - Growth sometimes comes from learning to navigate uncertainty, trust your demonstrated capabilities despite occasional setbacks. You're so much more than this.
> - True confidence isn't about never failing or always understanding why things happen as they do. It's about maintaining faith in your capabilities even when faced with unexpected outcomes.
> - The official test result is temporary (valid for 2 years as they say). It is a checkpoint for reflection rather than a final judgment. So, the **_true_** end goal is the person you become through dedicated practice, the person who can ==practically integrate the knowledge and skills that you have developed through the process== so that you evolve as an individual and benefit the society.

# Speaking
- Practice speaking your thoughts aloud. 
- A little bit of "how do you *feel* about it / how does it *affect* you" could help.
- Keep you speaking going with this formula: *Direct answer → Reasoning & evidence (if any) → Personal reflection (e.g. your emotions / What have you learned from it)*
> [!error] Get this right
> You can expand the argument, but ==**NEVER stray away from the main topic**== that you're discussing. Avoid pure listing. If you're trying to list, chain the items in a cohesive way. 
- Avoid complex vocabulary. Keep it simple and down to earth. This ***IS NOT*** a show off contest. They're expecting you to speak in a manner that poses no difficulty in understanding what you're saying.
- Never mention how you prepared for the test. No fucks given. Start directly with relevant content.
- Initiate your voice from your chest, not from your throat. Speak clearly with natural intonation and stress.
- Communicate in a clear and controlled manner. Relax. This is who you are. Speak slower to get your words right, that's OK. Try to express with a positive, engaging attitude.
- Minor grammar mistakes are acceptable as long as they don't significantly impair communication.
## Part 1 
- This part is about yourself. Questions about you. Tell your story. Lasts about 5 minutes. Keep your responses under 30 seconds.
- The first two or three questions of the interview are always on the subject of where you live or what you do or study.
- Take your time, especially at the start of the interview. This will help you relax.
- You can expand your answers, but remember to keep them specific and ==keep the main topic relevant.==
- ==A straight to the point answer is perfectly fine==. The examiner knows that a long response will be something you have rehearsed and so won’t be a good indication of your ability.
- Recommended structure for an answer: `Direct answer + Reason + Example/Personal experience`. For example:
	- Q: "Do you like reading?" 
	- A: "Yes, I'm quite passionate about reading `non-fiction`. It helps me develop a deeper understanding of `interpersonal dynamics and human behavior`. Currently, I'm reading `Skin in the Game` by `NNT` to decompress after work."
## Part 2
- The goal here is to speak _fluently and coherently_ for 2 minutes ==about the main topic==. Just keep yapping until the examiner tells you to stop.
- The bullet points are just cues and suggestions to help you out, so don't take them too seriously. You have the option to add more bullet points as long as they support _the main topic_. 
- If the topic is totally unfamiliar (the ones that caught you off guard), then start with something relevant in the same scope (i.e. your vocabulary should still be related to the topic of discussion). For example:
	- Topic: "Describe sailing a boat" 
	- Response: "While I haven't sailed personally, I can relate to learning new skills through my experience learning to ride a bike"  → Talk more about how specific bike _maneuvering_ techniques that you think would be transferable to sailing a boat.
- If you come to a stop, look again at the prompts in case you’ve missed one.
- Try not to use up all the material you’ve prepared in the first few sentences. Aim to expand on each of your notes as fully as possible before moving on to the next one.
- Paint a picture around _**the story**_ or event that you have to describe to give it as much life and interest as possible.
- You don't have to answer every bullet points as long as you're keeping the main topic relevant. Try to tell a story, put some _feeling_ into it.
- Common topics:
	- People (a single person related to some topic and how they affect your life)
	- Location (background, what activities going on there, your memories about the place)
	- Event/Activities (something happened in the past, talk about the context/background, what happened, where it took place, what you learnt from that exp)
	- Object/thing (same deal, describe the object, tell a story about it, mention the `sentimental value`, sense of `identity`)
- For padding in case you finished before the 2 minutes mark: conclude with a third condition statement (about you've learnt from that).
## Part 3
- This part ***discusses*** general topics in social contexts (relates to Part 2) in about 5 minutes. The way you answer them is similar to [[#The topics |Task 2 Writing]].
- If you don’t understand a question, it’s fine to ask the examiner to repeat it.
- As soon as you hear the question, give a general opinion/observation about the topic. Then give a specific reason or example in the next sentence or two.
- This is where you should develop your ideas. Be creative, but do not go off-topic.
- If the question ask about your opinion, use a contrasting structure, like this template: `It really depends on...and it varies from person to person.` + `For a lot of people,...` + `For example,...` + `And of course, for others,...` + `Having said that, I guess everyone is different and it really boils down to...`
## Strategies
- Paraphrasing:
	- "Very good" → "exceptional"
	- "Like" → "prefer", "become more in tune with"
	- "Important" → "crucial/vital"
	- "Famous for" → "Synonymous **_with_**"
	- "Think" → "believe/reckon/suppose"
	- "I think..." → "In my experience..." 
	- "Maybe..." → "It seems to me that..." 
	- "I believe..." → "From my perspective..."
	- "For example..." → "Well let's say..." → "...you name it."
- To buy time naturally (3s max):
	- "Actually, that's not something I've really thought about, but..."
	- "As far as I'm concerned..."
	- "If I had to consider this..."
	- "I am no expert to comment on this, but..."
	- "Well, I don’t think that it’s entirely true that..."
	- "While there's no definitive answer for that, my take is..."
	- "I mean..."
	- "You know..."
	- "It's hard to say whether..."
	- "Another way to put it is..."
	- "So this is one of those topics that I categorize under things that exist, and not things that I have an opinion about, but if I had to give answer, I'd say that..."
- It doesn't matter what your answer is, what's crucial is that you addressed the main topic, and the sentence's structure.
- Use "potential options" to give you some hints if you don't know what you're talking about.
> Pause appropriately after fully develop an idea no matter how short it is. Heighten your intonations if you're still expressing your idea.   
### Recommendations
- You should:
	- Comment on the question
	- Relate the question to your own experience
	- Divide up your answers (show a variety of short and long expressions)
	- Use different tenses correctly (present perfect, past, and future tenses)

--- 
# Listening
- Listen carefully to differentiate between similar characters (`b` vs `p`, `m` vs `n`, `e` vs `v`) when the track is spelling.
- Listen carefully to the pronunciation to detect the correct form (==singular/plural==, tenses,...). For example: `dairy` $\neq$ `diary`
- Again, this is the battle of paraphrasing. Read your question *carefully*, identify its *main* topic of discussion (i.e. what's this about), identify the keywords, recognize the synonyms.
>  Don't spend too much time on a question that you miss the remaining part of the track. 
## Strategies & Tips
### Before 
- Spend 30s on each section to skim the questions and note their keywords. Keep them in your RAM (especially for those multiple choice & mapping questions).
- Make educated guesses as you read the questions.
- Note the requirements (i.e. word limits, question type) and the **bold headings**.
	- Word **AND**/OR Number $\neq$ Word OR Number: 
		- Incorrect: `twelve years` → correct: `12 years`
		- Incorrect: `stone bridge` → correct: `bridge`
	- Write **NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS** for each answer: it is crucial to note that if the correct answer _requires both_ words to convey the complete and *accurate* meaning, then using only one word would be marked incorrect. For example:
		- Incorrect: `management` → correct: `time management` 
		- Incorrect: `phones` → correct: `smartphones
### During
- Follow question order.
- Write answers as you hear them and ==***listen ahead*** while writing. **DO NOT** get stuck on one answer.== Move on if uncertain.
- Move to next question *immediately* after answering.
- For decimal numbers, ==always use a decimal point, ***never a comma***==.
- ==For spelling answer, type as you hear==. Never try to guess it in advance.
- Listen for signposting language as they refer to the bold headings: "First," "Next," "Finally", "The main point is...", "There are `x` reasons...", "never/always", "probably/must/need",...
	- Also beware of trap answers where they mention "In fact,...", "But,...", "Actually,...", "However,...". ==Early mention doesn't equate to correct answer==, for example:
		- The question: What did Annie `discover` from reading about icehouses?
		- The track: *I’d been some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so `I knew` they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse. But `I didn’t realize` that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn’t melt for months*. 
		- The answer: *how the ice was kept frozen*, **not** *where they were located* 
- Pay attention to _emotional_ expressions for opinion-based questions (e.g. surprised, shocked, disappointed, disagree,...).
- Mark uncertain and/or unanswered questions to come back later.
#### Tips
- For part 3 and part 4, the answers are never mentioned directly (word-by-word) in the track. They're paraphrased, so you better not decide your answer from hearing identical words mentioned.
- ==DO NOT make advanced assumption==. For example, if you hear the track mentioned `dogs` and the corresponding question you're looking at is something like 'No `...` allowed', then the correct answer is `dogs`, _not_ `pets`.
- It is better to ==make **educated guesses** for unanswered questions== rather than to try to memorize the track, which inadvertently increases your cognitive load for the upcoming sections of the exam.
- Pay close attention to the singular/plural word form for Fill In The Blank type of questions. If you're not sure if it's singular or plural, it's most likely a plural.
- Look for clues from the lexical context:
	* Articles: a, an, the 
	* Prepositions: in, at, on 
	* Verb agreements: is, are
	* Grammatical clues
* For multiple choice (single answer) questions: 
	* Read question stems FIRST (because they are the signposts to navigate the track)
	- Then read ALL options
	- Note the key differences between options and beware of the true but irrelevant information
### After
- Come back to those questions that you marked earlier.
- Never leave any questions unanswered. Try to make educated guesses.
# Reading
- It's better to answer fewer questions correctly than to rush through all of them making careless mistakes:
	- Make sure to get the easy ones right, and *make **educated** guesses* for the harder ones.
	- It's always better to have an answer for every question than to leave some blank.
	- Watch for singular/plural answers.
- This is the battle of paraphrasing. Carefully read your questions, identify its *main* topic of discussion (i.e. what's this about) and then appropriately apply these strategies:
## Strategies
- For the total of 60 minutes, here's how you can optimally allocate your execution:
	- Start with Section 3 (20 mins) 
	- Then Section 2 (20 mins) 
	- Finally Section 1 (15 mins)
	- Review your answers and come back to those questions that you marked as "not sure" (5 mins)
- These are the essential skills for every section that should (but not always) be applied in order:
	1. **Skimming**: your goal is to *get a general idea* of the content and structure of the passage.
	2. **Scanning**: you must be able to *locate* the relevant part from "the text below" and the (possibly paraphrased) keywords of the statement.
	3. **Close reading**: make sure to clearly identify its *main* topic of discussion.
- ==Spend no more than 2 minutes for each answer.== Move on quickly if you don't find an answer.
- ==Practice reading in chunks== rather than word by word.
- Focus on first/last sentences of paragraphs.
- Always read the passage first, *except* for TFNG.
### TFNG
- Don't make assumptions based on general knowledge or let previous answers influence your judgment.
- Aim to complete this task within a 10-minute window. 
> [!info] Tackle the statements in order
> The order of the statements are *usually* mapped to the order of the paragraphs.
- Follow these steps *in order*:
	1. **Skim** the questions and the text quickly (1-2 minutes): note main topics of each *paragraph* (in 5 words or less).
	2. **Closely read** the statements carefully (1-2 minutes per statement): this is where the "paraphrasing" takes place.
	3. **Predict** your answer (10 seconds): formulate your answer before going back to the paragraphs.
	4. **Scan** for key words (30 seconds per statement): ***locate*** the relevant paragraph topic (that you noted in step 1), then ***locate*** the relevant ***keywords*** in the statement and keep your eyes for those (*possibly paraphrased*) keywords in the filtered passage excerpt.
	5. Make your decision and move on (==do **not** spend more than 2 minutes in total for each statement==): if unsure, mark it as "Not Given".
	6. Review (if you finished within 10 minutes): watch for qualifying words (all, some, never, always)
#### How to identify a "NOT GIVEN"
- A **NOT GIVEN** means the passage ==_**lacks** the information_== necessary to either *agree or disagree* with the statement. 
	- Analyze what the passage _tells_ us and ==what it **_DOES NOT_** _mention_==. 
	- Don’t assume based on your lexical knowledge. Focus on the statement only: is the identified passage answer *directly* to the statement or not.
	- The excerpt may seem true, but it's not strong enough to completely gravitate toward the claim in the statement → ==the statement _**must** either_ confirm or deny it== (i.e. narrowed down enough). For example:
		- The excerpt: "If you receive a pension, we may give you a reduction on your bill, but you _**must** own and live in_ your home to qualify for this."
		- The statement: "Pensioners who **_live in rented_** accommodation might get a discount." → FALSE
		- The rationale: Home ownership is clearly stated as a _requirement_, _therefore_, pensioners in rented accommodation _cannot_ get a reduction, i.e. the passage _contradicts_ the statement.
- For example: 
	- The excerpt: "If your property has no meter, we send the bill at the start of each quarter." 
	- The statement: "Customers who don't have a water meter must pay an extra charge." → NG
	- The rationale: the passage _**does not mention**_ any information _about charges or costs_. It stops at _when_ the bill is sent, i.e. _not strong enough_ to be a FALSE.
##### Tips
- If you can't find _related_ information quickly, it's *likely* NG. 
- If either the statement or the passage contain absolute language (e.g. must, never, always, everyone, no one, all, none,...), it's _likely_ FALSE.
### The order of execution
- Complete your question types in this order:
	1. Multiple choice
	2. Fill in the blank
	3. Matching: Header → Information (paragraph/feature) matching, mostly require skimming and scanning
	4. TFNG
---
# Writing
- Generally, 2 to 4 paragraphs is the sweet spot for an 8+ band, in terms of length (of course you must also be mindful of the minimum of 150 words for task 1 (the ideal is 180~250 words) and 250~350 words for task 2.
- Each paragraph must focus on ==**_one_**== *main* idea.
- It is very important to *separate your content ideas into clear paragraphs* so that the examiner can see them immediately. ==Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence.==
- The tasks last 20 minutes for task 1 and 40 minutes for task 2. ==Execute task 2 first.==
> Confusion ***must not*** be raised from your writing. Don’t be tempted to use any word that you would be uncomfortable to use in spoken conversation.
- In any case, your "padding" to the details should feel realistic, tangible and ==***relevant***==, rather than some made up statistics or being too dramatic or too many unnecessary specific details.

> [!info]- Practicing tips
> Write your first draft, then:
> - Paraphrase to the point where it satisfies all requirements (i.e. a strong band 8)
> - Write down the keywords for each idea/paragraph
> - Rewrite the whole thing with the suggestions above (maximum 3 rewrites for an essay, then move on)
> - Strict timing on the first draft and the rewrites. Your final rewrite should last no longer than 30 minutes (for task 2) and 15 minutes (for task 1).

## Task 1
- This test requires you to think very carefully about ***the recipient*** (the person reading the letter) ***the content*** (the ideas and details you create) and ***the style*** of the writing.
	- If the IELTS examiner thinks you are confused about the recipient and the style, and if your content does not answer the task properly, you will get a low score – even if your English is quite good.
	- Don’t invent too many complicated details about the situation, *even if you know a lot about the topic*. Try to ==keep the details quite simple==.
### Get this right
- There are 3 critical points to focus on for this task:
	- The *imaginary* ***recipient*** of the letter (a stranger or someone you know personally)
	- The correct ***style*** to use (personal, formal or semi-formal)
	- The ***content*** of the letter (a typical *mix* of expressions: ==complaining, requesting, explaining/apologizing/thanking, suggesting==)
> Ask yourself, "**Why** am I writing this letter? What **combination** of content do I need to create?"
- How to map them out (within the first ==3 minutes==):
	- **Recipient**: 
		- Semi Stranger - formal / semi-formal (you can recognize this style if the question mentions "*the relevant person*" or someone specific, e.g. the store manager, the governor,...): "Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. `firstName`,..."
		- Complete Stranger - formal (usually for *complaining/requesting* for a service offered by *an organization*): "Dear Sir or Madam,..."
		- Someone you know personally - personal/semi-formal: "Dear `firstName`,"
	- **Content**: read the prompt *very carefully* (specifically the part after "In your letter,...") and you should ==recognize the required *mix* of expressions you ***must*** include. You ***must not*** mention any expression that *isn't* in the requirement== (e.g. a seemingly polite "apologizing for contacting the recipient" _would be **invalid**_ if the prompt doesn't explicitly state that you should apologize)
		- **Complaining**: a letter of complaint to a business, requesting and suggesting are often similar in content, in *formal* style. You're expected to give a replacement/repair/immediate refund request if it's about a product. 
			- Start with "*I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with*...." or "_I am writing concerning_...". Try to craft your sentences in a contrast manner between `your expectation` and `your issue` (e.g. "_The active noise-cancelling feature that worked flawlessly during the in-store demonstration no longer blocks external sounds_."). For padding: "*I am confident that your offer is good enough to keep my custom*." End it with a "Kind regards,".
		- **Requesting**: this should be in a polite but firm tone, e.g. "*Given these circumstances, I request*...". ==Use indirect questions to begin a request for help or information== (e.g. "*I wonder if you could send me the course details urgently, as I wish to apply very soon.*")
- The general structure:
	1. Greeting (1 line): pay very close attention to the question, it should tell you something like =="Begin your letter ‘Dear --------’"==
	2. First paragraph: An overview of "what is this about", addressing the first required expression
	3. Second paragraph: The meat (a hint of "how do you *feel* about it/how does it *affect* you, could help), extending the first required expression and focus on the second required expression.
	4. Third paragraph: Extra meat (but still meat, don't go veggie here), extending the previous expressions and focus on the final required expression. Remember that these 3 paragraphs don't have to be in the same length.
	5. Closing (3 lines: CTA → farewell → your name)
#### Tips
- A paragraph for each bullet point. Sure, you can cram 2 bullet points into one paragraph, but a clear isolation of the paragraph-bullet point pair is always preferred.
- Straight up answering each required expression in 2-3 sentences is the way to go.
- Use "although" instead of "even though" at the start of a sentence.
- Use more logical connectors (however, when, not only... but also,...)
- **For formal style**: use formal words such as "regarding, remains, considerable, commotion, appreciate, restrict,..."
	- ==**Don't** use contractions== (e.g. don’t, can’t, shouldn't,...) 
	- Use formal phrases:
		- I am writing concerning...
		- I am sure you will appreciate that...
		- May I suggest that...
		- I therefore request that you...
		- Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
	- Write in a calm and professional manner, show appreciation (with a positive comment regarding the topic) where appropriate.
	- ==Keep your emotions to a minimum==.
	- For apologizing: use phrases like "Please accept my apologies for this...", "On behalf of everyone concerned, I would like to offer apologies for this...". ==For padding, use: "I was very concerned when I realized that our misunderstanding caused you such inconvenience."==
- **For semi-formal style**:
	- **Don't** use "Dear Sir or Madam,"
	- Use these phrases:
		- Why don’t we... / How about...
		- If I were you, I’d...
		- Do you remember when we...
		- Here’s an idea...
		- The thing / the problem is that...
		- I’m really sorry that...
		- As you will appreciate... (it's a better way of saying "I am sure you can understand that...")
		- Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday (*not* ‘I look forward,’ which is formal)
	- ==The distinction between formal and semi-formal==:
		- Formal: the recipient *is senior* to you in age or authority, is not obliged to follow your suggestions (e.g. something like "I hope it will be acceptable if..." is preferable), or you're complaining or insisting on something.
		- Semi-formal: the recipient is *probably not* senior to you, and you're inquiring some kind of explanation or expressing an interest.
	- If you're not really sure if the style should be formal or personal, the safe bet is to go formal.
	- ==Remember that formal and personal letter tasks are way more common than semi-formal letter tasks.==
- **For personal style**:
	- You can recognize this style if the question has the word "friend" in it.
	- Should begin with "Dear + `firstName`". ***Never*** open with "Dear friend".
	- Showing your feelings is actually recommended for this type of letter.
	- It's ok to make a small joke. Remember, just _**one** small joke_. Don't over do this.
	- You're free to use contractions, phrasal verbs and informal vocabulary (because they're less serious, indicating that you're trying to be friendly and "on the same level"). Words like "really, pretty, kind of,..." are acceptable.
	- ==For checking in, use "*I hope all is going well for you in...*" instead of "*How's it going in...*"==
	- Using the "zero conditional" (`If` + `present simple,` + `can` → "*If you let me know the arrival time, I can meet you in my car.*") or "first conditional" (`If` + `present tense,` + `will` → "*If you send out the party invitations, I’ll bring all the food*.") is a good way to *make requests or suggestions*.
	- For apologizing: keep it short and simple: "forgive me", "sorry". ==Use this: "If it’s any comfort, I feel terrible about it too." in case you want padding.==
- **For endings**: 
	- Formal recipient CTA: use "I look forward to + `V-ing (NOT hearing)`...", "I would appreciate your reply with...", "Thank you for your help/consideration, and I await...".
	- Formal recipient farewell: use "Kind regard==***s***==, / Best regard==_**s**_==, /Your==***s***== sincerely, / Your==***s***== faithfully,".
	- Formal and semi-formal recipient: finish with your `firstName lastName`.
	- Personal CTA: "Do let me know...", "Please get in touch...", "I can’t wait to..."
	- Personal farewell: use "All the best, `\n yourFirstName`."
		- Alternatives for "All the best,": Very best wishes, / Take care, / See you soon, / Thinking of you, / Keep in touch,.
	- Always ==use your real first name + surname== in the way it appears on your IELTS candidate paper. Don’t use an imaginary name at the end, because this makes the letter unrealistic.
	- CTA: remember to express appreciation if your content is *requesting* something:
		- Formal: =="*Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated,== and I look forward to your response.*"
	- Don't add anything to your name (i.e. the last line of your letter should only contain your name, no matter what style it is).
	- ==The very last character ***must not*** be a full stop (.)==
	- Never use "PS" in a formal letter. It's the last ditch effort for a *personal* letter *if* it's not meeting the minimum length of 150 words.  

> [!important]- Never include your opinions or ideas about topics or trends in society. For this task, it's considered "padding", which heavily reduces your score.
- **About numbers**: don't write numbers in numeric format unless you're describing a universally expected numeric format, like date (September $6^{th}$, 1969), currency ($69.96), room number (room 69), a page of a book (page 96),...
	- **Don't** use the comma (,) for decimal point, use the dot (.) instead. Commas are used for thousands (e.g. $1,299.99)
	- Use the hyphen when the number is multi-digit (e.g. twenty-five years old)
##### Time allocation
- Spend no more than 5 minutes (ideally within the first 3 minutes) to analyze and make notes about the required recipient, style, and content details.
- Finish your letter in about 10 minutes, aiming for about 200 words.
- Finally, spend about 5 minutes checking your letter for mistakes and paraphrasing.

## Task 2
- Use ==***cohesion***== in such a way that it attracts no attention. The linking / transition between sentences and paragraphs should help with the ==development== of ideas but *does ==**not*** overshadow== the ideas.
- Present a fully developed position in ==answer to the question with ***relevant***, easy to understand, straightforward, fully extended and well supported ideas==. Strong thesis statements and topic sentences are the main goal.
- ***MOST IMPORTANT***: The taken position should be *clear **throughout*** the essay (i.e. presented in the introduction, and then supported in the rest of the essay, with ==no surprises / unexpected turn in the conclusion==).
### The topics
#### Opinion
- This is the *most common* prompt for the task. The question is "...do ***==you== agree or disagree***?" 
- You can either strongly or *partly* agree/disagree. Take a clear, definitive position rather than offering an ambiguous/irrelevant response.
- Introduction for "disagree": `Paraphrased prompt` + _While they may find some comfort in holding this opinion, I strongly believe that..._
> If the question doesn't mention "to what extent...", then a one-sided perspective is always recommended. 

> [!important]- Partly agree/disagree
> - Use "On one hand..." to start the first paragraph, and "However..." or "On the other hand..." to start the second paragraph. 
> - Be careful with "extreme" questions, e.g. those with strong claim such as "most important...", "absolute...", "totally...", especially where it ends **without** the "To what extend...". If you choose to disagree, then your answer should carry ==**equal**== weight to the question's subject matter.

> [!danger] Get the topic right
In the end, it's still your ***personal*** take on the subject, so you must **avoid** impersonal language like "**It** is believed...", "**It** is considered..."

> [!info]- Counterarguments
> If you feel like you need to include a counterargument (as an example), do so in a way that further reinforce your answer, ***not*** as a way to support that counterargument.
> Your answer to the topic should behave as a counter to those counterarguments.
#### Discussion
- The question is "Discuss ==***both*** views== and give ***your*** opinion" or "***advantages/disadvantages***"
- This is basically a [[#Opinion |partly]] agree/disagree prompt, but for social topics, rather than personal views.
- ==If you picked a side, discuss the other side first.== For example:
	- Your stance: "_I contend that the advantages of `the topic` clearly outweigh its drawbacks._", then:
	- Discuss the drawbacks first, start with something like:
		- "_Despite the potential benefits, this `topic` presents **considerable challenges** that **warrant** careful consideration._" 
		- "_One significant concern is_..." 
		- "_One undeniable downside of_ `the topic` is..."
	- Then, on the next paragraph: "_While these pressures exist, **they are offset by** remarkable advances in_..." or "_Despite these concerns, the `descriptive noun` benefits of `the topic` are compelling and far-reaching._"
- If it's a "discuss both views", then:
	- The introduction should include `subject of debate`, `some arguing...` - `while others believe...` or `some contend that...` - `while other maintain that...`
	- After 2 paragraphs for each view, you should have an extra paragraph that starts with "_Weighing these factors, I believe that..._"
> If you can't pick a side, then you must give the 2 arguments equal weight.

- Start the conclusion with: "_While acknowledging the downsides, I strongly believe that..._"

> [!danger] Get the topic right
> - The discussion focuses on the use of "they" or other ==***plural pronouns***==. 
> - The key to differentiate between a Discussion and an Opinion question is the pronoun it mentions.
> - Make sure that your claim is still personal, i.e. "I believe that...", "I personally prefer..."
#### Cause/problem and Solution
- The question is "What _**problems**/**issues**_...", "Suggest some measures..."
- The intro: 
	- _"In recent years, it is true that `the topic`. While a number of factors explain this `phenomenon/tendency/trend`, some `countries/individuals` have taken measures to reduce..._"
	- "_In recent years, it is true that `the topic`. Several problems have resulted from this `phenomenon/tendency/trend/view` and they should be tackled by a number of effective solutions from `all levels of society`._"
- First paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various issues. For example: "..._several multifaceted problems can be anticipated_."
	- Next sentences: extend 2 prominent issues. Elaborate *why* they are considered issues, what's wrong with them, and give example (optional)
- Second paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various solutions. For example: "_There are several resolutions to alleviate_..."
	- Next sentences: corresponding solutions to the issues *mentioned in the first paragraph*. Optionally, you can add a general solution to the prompt's question or something like: "_While there's no silver bullet to/for `the issue`, I’m confident that with dedication and integrity, we can steadily make progress and alleviate the difficulties_".
#### Two-part Question
- The prompt's structure: a claim + first question about the prompt + second question about the claim (or follow up to the first question)
- The introduction: 
	- First sentence: *paraphrase* the given topic.
	- Second sentence: further extend/acknowledge the claim/the questions (i.e. it's ok to not answer the questions *yet*), or you can answer both questions in this 1 sentence.
- First paragraph: answer the first question, then further explain and reinforce your answers. Give examples where possible.
- Second paragraph: same thing, for the second question.
### The structure
#### The introduction
- Ideal length: 1 paragraph with 2 sentences. This is the same for all topics, except for the "two-part question" type. ==Spend at most 5 minutes for this section.==
	- **First sentence**: you can either *paraphrase* the given topic or *mention other perspective* on the topic. For example:
		- Padding: 
			- "_In this day and age..._"
			- "_Over the past few decades,_..."
			- "_In today's fast-paced world,..._"
			- "_In recent years_,..."
			- "_Since the digital revolution,..._"
		- Paraphrasing: "Governments should financially support businesses which are facing the possibility of going bankrupt."  → "_It is of great necessity for governments to provide financial aids for businesses which are coping with the possibility of bankruptcy_."
		- Alternative viewpoints: 
			- *Considering the personal preferences in / disparity of perspectives on* `[the topic]`..., _various proponents argue for_...`[the topic]`
			- _While the `[paraphrased first half of the topic]`, the claim that `[paraphrased second half of the topic]` oversimplifies a complex reality_.
			- `[The paraphrased statement]` _is a subject of debate, with some arguing that_ `[paraphrased first half of the topic]`, _while others believe_ `[paraphrased second half of the topic]`
	- **Last sentence**: explicitly answer the given question in a concise, direct manner. Use phrases like: "It strikes ***me*** that...", "In ***my*** view...", "==***I*** contend that==...", "_**I**_ am convinced that..." For example:
		- "While this is certainly the case _in some respects_,..., I *believe* in general..." 
		- "While it's undeniable that..., I am _confident_ that..."
		- "Although I recognize `[(paraphrased) first half of the topic]`, I disagree with this statement, as `[your take]`."
- A full example: 
	- Question: _All cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them. Do you agree or disagree?_
	- Introduction: 
		- **First sentence**: While many people advocate for a transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles as our main mode of transportation, an outright ban on combustion engines would have far-reaching consequences. 
		- **Next sentence**: The negative impacts - affecting everything from employment and everyday convenience to unexpected environmental challenges - could outweigh the intended benefits.
> This part of the essay introduces your opinion, so use declarative statements only. Never include any question here.
#### The body
- Ideally 2 paragraphs (so that you qualify the time constraint), 4-6 sentences each. ==Spend 30 minutes for this section.== For a paragraph:
	- **First sentence**: introduce your take on the issue.
	- **Next sentence**: clarify / extend your take (*why* do you think that...)
	- **Next 1-2 sentences**: further clarify / extend your take
	- **Last 1-2 sentences**: reaffirm / strengthen your claim with specific examples.
- First sentence example: _The argument for_ replacing libraries with digital alternatives _rests on_ compelling technological advances.
- For the first sentence of the *second* paragraph, it should demonstrate either a smooth transition from the first paragraph (e.g. expanding/supplementing the previous statement), or expressing a counterargument (depending on the requirement). For example: "Complementing/Opposing `[the previous topic]`,...", "Another crucial factor regarding....", "When it comes to..."
#### The conclusion
- ==Spend 5 minutes on this section.==
- Always start with "In conclusion,..." or "To recap,...". For padding, you may use "Looking at the broader picture, we can see that..."
- For advantage/disadvantage discussion, use "To maximize the benefits while minimizing the drawbacks...", "To make this work,...".
- ==***Reaffirm*** your answer in the introduction by paraphrasing / extending it==.
	- You can also compose this part by combining and paraphrasing the thesis statement and the topic sentences in the body.
	- "Excluding `your stance` would be _shortsighted_."
	- `Your statement` leads to... `something positive`. This _thoughtful_ approach `not only...but also` contributes to a more resilient society through...
	- The very last sentence: "_...open to growth opportunities that benefit both individuals and communities_".
### Tips
- Spend *under* 10 minutes on planning when the timer starts. Get your topic right and map out the intended structure (e.g. what should your first and second paragraph discuss about)
- ==Get specific (*with examples*).== If you're overgeneralizing, the highest you can get is a 7.
- It is recommended to use nouns in plural form (they, people,...)
- Prefer present perfect continuous tense over present perfect.
- Use `moreover` when your second point strengthens your argument significantly. Use `furthermore/additionally` when adding related supporting details of similar importance.
- Spend no more than 30 minutes on actually writing the essay. Take note of sentences that need paraphrasing as you write.
	- Introduction: under 5 minutes
	- Each paragraph of the body: no more than 8 minutes
	- Conclusion: less than 4 minutes
- For an 8+ TR yield, your thesis statement should be visible it the introduction **_and_** the conclusion.  
- If you're doing great, you should have less than 5 minutes to:
	- ***Check for errors*** (grammatical and syntax)
	- Paraphrase noted sentences. ==**Avoid perfectionism**==. Prefer repeating words rather than replacing them with inappropriate synonyms.
- Cohesion and coherence devices: 
	- For one thing/Firstly, Consequently, Moreover, Additionally, What's more...
	- Complimenting, Opposing, Conversely, Especially/particularly...
	- As a result,...
	- Reflects a broader truth about...
	- Instead, Even so, 
	- This results in,...
	- Depends on → hinges on
	- Given... → In light of...
- Describing trajectory: gaining traction, gaining momentum, becoming popular, undermining, compromising, downward/upward trajectory, evolved impressively, offering benefits like..., promising opportunities..., growing trend, this shift, this approach, this movement,...
- Comparison: stark disparity, clear contrast,
- Use these words more often: genuine, meaningful, profound, authentic, facilitate, develop, foster, promote, ==make way for==... 
- Examples: A prime example would be...; Take, for instance...., Norway `exemplifies` proper law enforcement
- Synonyms: 
	- Society: today's fast-paced world, the modern era, the modern life, our rapidly evolving world, social dynamics, social contexts, interconnected world,...
	- Underdeveloped: in its infancy
	- Important: crucial, essential, vital, indispensable {for}
	- Public facilities/services (school, hospitals,...): municipal facilities, convenient access to work and amenities
	- Housing: real estate, residential properties, rental properties, rental accommodations...
	- Sports: media coverage, PEDs, illegal substances, sports merchandising, endorsement of sporting goods,...
	- Business: gain a competitive edge, maximize profits, break into new markets, operating margin,...
- Collocations:
	- Advantages: significant, substantial, remarkable, notable, major benefits, pivotal improvements, `the benefits` appeal to, endorse, promote, embrace, thrive, superseded by,...
	- Challenges: major hurdles, this problem becomes particularly **_acute_** in, deterrent...

## Things to NEVER do
- Use questions of any form, *especially in the introduction*.
- Use idioms, clichés, proverbs, slang or text abbreviations in any type of letter:
	- Common clichés *to avoid*: 
		- At the end of the day...
		- Second of all...
		- Last but not least...
		- To cut a long story short... / In short.../ In a nutshell...
		- To sum up... / To summarize... / In summary....
		- All things considered....
		- I look forward **to hearing** from you.
	- Try to explain yourself clearly without using proverbs, e.g. you can replace the "Too many cooks spoil the broth" proverb with: 
		- Formal voice: "I am worried that the team is too large and so the decision-making is slow."
		- Personal voice: "There are too many people involved these days, and so not much is really getting done."
	- Words like "a nerd/a geek/a creep" or "awesome/cool/wicked/sick" are considered slang. Don't use names for streets, buildings,... in your native language (e.g. Bến Nhà Rồng → Dragon House Harbor). If there is no direct translation, just create a suitable English name, e.g. "There is a big festival here called the National Spring Festival."
- Use quotes. Quotations are marked as "memorized language", which heavily deducts your score.
- Invent statistics, especially numeric statistics. Rather than relying on invented statistics, focus on expressing your own views.
- Raise mental bandwidth to understand what you're trying to convey. ==The easier it is to understand your writing, the higher your score.==
