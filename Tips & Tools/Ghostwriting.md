## Voices (personalities)
- Ghostwriting is not about magically creating a custom voice for every client. It’s about aligning expectations _with_ your client.
- In their very first draft, give them:
	- A Story
	- An Opinion
	- A Relevant Study
	- A Named Framework (how to achieve something)
	- An Abrasive Sarcastic Rant
- Then, see which pieces they like, don’t like, or want changed—and adjust from there.
