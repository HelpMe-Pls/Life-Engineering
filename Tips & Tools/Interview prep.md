# Before the interview
- Pay attention to the yearly reports from Adecco, First Alliance, Navigos, Vietnamwork, Talentnet, NodeFlair,... to see where the market is heading, and base your skills on that.
- Include keywords from job descriptions into your resume. Analyze the job description and determine how important each skill and experience is, then optimize the *frequency* of the keyword according to its importance/relevance.
- The interview is all about selling how well you communicate. Be sure that you can answer 2-3 levels deep questions clarifying each and every of your bullet points in your CV. For example, the interviewer may ask 3 questions to clarify this one: "*With an everlasting curiosity and a relentless drive to adapt, I am experienced in modern web development with a strong foundation in web technologies*.":
	- Give me an experience in your work that highlights your trait of "everlasting curiosity and a relentless drive to adapt".
	- How does that have anything to do with a strong foundation in web technologies?
	- Some random follow-up question based on your answer to those 2 questions above.
- The most important takeaway is that “***every interview is a learning process***”. If you made it to the screening rounds, consider that a win already. Don't beat yourself up that you didn't get the offer that you're hoping for. Maybe that's a bless in disguise that you just haven't realized yet. *Take it like a man. Don't be a little bitch. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Dust off and move on. Life is so much more than that*. Write down what you learned from that one what could be better for the next ones.
- It is essential to realize that even if you are well-suited to a position, there is always the possibility that a more experienced candidate is also being interviewed. So, rather than being idle and having high hopes for some particular interview, just keep practicing and review your knowledge to prepare for upcoming ones. 
- Pride in appearance can be equated with pride in a role.
- [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IInaPtwdNCQ)
- If you're unsure whether or not the interview will be technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what position your interviewer holds (or what the interview might cover). An engineer will usually perform a technical interview.
- You typically do one or two virtual interviews before being brought on-site.
- [Do your research](https://www.experis.com/en/insights/articles/2021/05/25/20-tips-for-great-job-interviews), figure out what problems their business is trying to solve. Ask for an example of their product, and it'd be great if you can offer *specific* improvements and/or alternate approaches, better yet, mention the trade offs of your suggestions as well (get [refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/?ref=biblidev.fr))
- Be _extremely_ familiar with the following concepts:
	- CSS: Specificity, Box model, Layout, Positioning
	- JS: `this` keyword, Prototypes, closures, Async-style code, Promises, Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
	- JS design patterns: Observer pattern, Module pattern
	- HTML: [Event delegation](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/javascript-questions#explain-event-delegation) (useful in almost every interview), [DOM traversal](https://javascript.info/dom-navigation), [DOM Manipulation](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom), [form controls](https://javascript.info/forms-controls)
	- Vanilla JS, or jQuery at the very least. Not all interviews allow you to use React as they want to see mastery of the fundamentals.
	- [[Networking |Basic]] networking knowledge.
- Many ***startups*** might post job listings, but for the hottest startups, often *the best way in is through a personal referral*. This reference doesn't necessarily need to be a close friend or a coworker. Often just by reaching out and expressing your interest, you can get someone to pick up your resume to see if you're a good fit.
- Regardless of the outcome, always ask yourself, did I present myself to the best of my ability? If you did, then there's no reason to keep lingering on it. If you didn't, ask yourself: "What are the things that I learned from this interview that can help me to get better in subsequent interviews?"
- Aim for the companies that on the bottom of your list in the first month of applying (i.e. treat them as foreplay for the companies that you *really* want to work at)
> [!Info]- Good to know
> - It is recommended to carefully pick your next company once you already have 1+ YoE. It's not just about the benefits that the company offers, you should also have a good sense that the company fits you.
> - Make an effort to update your CV and scout for jobs every 6 months and apply selectively, just to see where you're at in the market and to take an opportunity if its tradeoff is good enough.
> - You should typically stay with a company for 2-3 years before really **hunt** for a new one. It looks better on your CV, and you get to go **all the way** through the life cycle of a project and learn everything that evolved around it.
> - It is almost a red flag if you change your job too frequently, so consider your time with a company in the "year" unit. 
> - Be a generalist at life but a specialist at your job.
> - Red flags to be aware of:
> 	-  If they're looking a some kind of 'A-team' or 'hit the ground and running', then just get tf outta there asap. 
> 	- Their JD is generic and you just can't make out what specific type of employee they're looking for.
## Actionable steps
- Get specific about what you really want (i.e. niching down): the specific role/title/responsibilities, specific perks/location about the job
	- Then, rank them in order of significance, e.g. Junior/Mid Fullstack Software Engineer $\gt$ Backend Engineer $\gt$ Frontend Engineer
	- Tie them into your current season (growth/lifestyle/reinvention) to niche down even further
	- Research (reach out to those people who are working - ideally alumni/former employee - at your dream company and ask them out, get the intel on what it's like working there)
		- If you're looking at a former employee's profile, also have a look at their entire career progression and see if any of those companies interest you
	- Networking (make use of your existing network and/or get in touch with the employers that you want to work for and pitch them yourself)
		- Find the experts: filter by industry + role + people on LinkedIn, prioritize warm connections (1st and 2nd degree). Aim for _**at least**_ 5 people per week. First send them an email, if no response within 2 days, message them on LinkedIn, if ghosted for 2 more days, message on other platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,...)
		- Reach out on Monday or Tuesday (ideally). Arrange calls or meetings (the more the better)
		- Once you're on the live conversation, craft your questions in a way that they show ==care _**about them**_==. Remember, you're adding value, not pestering them. Try to find common ground and share your experience along the way.
	- Test the market (spar interviews)
	- Narrow down those few companies that fit you and focus on them
- Embrace impermanence: The best thing you can do is make the optimal decision for you today, and then have confidence in yourself that if and when your needs change, you will be able to *adapt* down the road.
## Preparation
- Try to investigate the pain points that the opening position is trying to solve. Craft your achievements and evidence accordingly (prepare a briefcase or slideshows for this).
> [!important] Be specific
> - Be prepared to demonstrate how you meet the qualifications of the job by sharing _**specific examples**_ from your past or ideas about how you would accomplish a specific task.
> - Be sure to share how skills you have gained throughout your career will _**translate to the role**_ for which you are interviewing.
- During the interview, present them your detailed plan, guide them through it, and show how tangible your contribution to their team can be.
### Profile
- Keep in mind that your resume is not all there is. It's your network that helped you land your dream job to begin with. So put your effort in building your network before even thinking about this.
#### JD
- It is essential to pick out the bullet points that have higher impact and align with your strength so then you can craft your narrative around them.  
#### Cover letter
- The purpose of it is to answer the question: "_==**Why**== should someone interview you for this job_?" or "_Why should they care?_"
- It's similar to [[Writing#The structure |copy writing]], but the product is you and your expertise.
- Your narrative should be [[Writing#Why |precise]] and [[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |persuasive]]. Get into their minds to see what they want by doing your research on their JDs.
- Again, this is about _your story_, so craft your words in a way that evokes emotions. The reader should **_feel_** something (good) reading your letter. Show some personality, avoid clichés and robotic phrases. Make it _**==memorable and relevant==**_ to the role that you're applying to.
- Turn their problems into rhetorical questions so that the hiring manager can nod along. These questions should feel like you're addressing their "pain point" and act as cohesive device for your next statements. Show your ambition and will to solve their problems.
#### Resume
- Your resume **_must_** gracefully answer these 2 questions: "Who are you?" and "==**_What_**== can you do for me?"
- A narrative is a 1-2 sentences impression _about you_ that someone forms after a quick glance at your resume. A recommended formula to build your narrative: "_I'm `...`, the `[your ideal role]` who can help you_ `...`"
- Choose your narrative then **_craft the bullet points around it_**. For example: "_I'm Khoi and I'm interested in technology and user experience with experimental knowledge in software engineering._"
- Bullet points should be specific (credibility markers), quantitative, and express impact (what ==tangible value== does it bring) with descriptive words.
> [!info]- Ideal situation
> You should have around 5 versions of your resume that are tailored to the corresponding JDs of your selected dream companies.
#### Merits
- Make your briefcase. Refer to [[Progressive Overload |this]]

# During the interview
- Listen until the question is finished, and take a breath. Ask clarifying questions if you didn't really get what their intention is about.
> [!info]- Connect over business
> - If you're too stressed out, try to reframe your mindset by thinking: "We're not here for business, we're here to connect. I'm here to have an _interesting_ conversation about my job." 
> - If the interviewer mentioned anything that you are also interested in, whether it be their work or a hobby, that's your chance to show warmth.
>- Just make it pop with your enthusiasm. Work on your facial expressions. Smile. Chill. Pause and raise your eyebrows if their question is good. Connect with them and you'll have the business you want.
- Don't answer their questions just for the sake of answering questions, _==it's more about **delivering your key message**==_. Ideally, your answers should be able to implicitly reassure them (or at least give a hint) that it's beneficial for them to have you on their team.
	- If they're discussing _the problems_ they're facing, try your very best to ==_relate and **show empathy**_==. That's how you leave a good impression with them on a subconscious level.
- Be aware of the position you're applying to so that you can tell your story in a way that _highlights your expertise_.
- If any of the interview rounds running over the scheduled time, then you got one foot in the door.
> [!important]- MOST IMPORTANT: Take ownership
> - Take control of the interview. Show them that their questions are just guidelines for your upcoming answers, then answer those questions to the fullest extent possible (as if you're teaching them about your achievement, in a subtle way).
> - There's a distinct difference between actually answering the question and rambling. To avoid rambling, you get straight to the point, cut out unnecessary information and ideally, your answers should serve as hooks to get them asking more clarifying questions (which you already anticipated). For example, if the question is: "**_what’s your dream job_**?", then your answer should be something like:
> 	- _My dream job has three essential pieces. It involves **architectural design and strategic thinking**. It focuses on **scalable, reliable** software development. And it's **impactful** - creating software that solve users needs. Those three things which I believe are the core value at your team_.
> 	- Those words in bold are the ones that serve as hooks.
> - Initiate the speech from the diaphragm to add confidence in your voice.
- If they ask you a question that caught you off guard, go with this: "_I've never went through this before, but here's my take_...". ==It's OK to take a moment before answering the question==. The key here is that you must ==let them know that you're willing to figure things out and take ownership of your problem==. 
	- Skip the "_It depends..._" and get straight to fixing things. Show them you're a problem-solver, not just someone who explains why things went wrong.
	- If you really know the answer, try to ==lay out on the table various relevant options==, something like: "_You know, I could answer that in three different ways. I could talk about tools, I could talk about strategies. I could talk about communications. Which one is valuable to you?_"
	- If it's about your employment gap, just be honest, tell them the story, then quickly pivot it back to how your goals align with theirs and why you decided to work at their company.
	- If it's about your weaknesses, talk about them with optimism, make it sound like you're on an adventure to level up: "_I do have two of the three skills and a third skill, I will feel very `confident in that by the time this role begins`._”

> [!important] NEVER EVER play the victim
> - You must show them that:
> 	- You're in charge of your decisions
> 	- You take ownership of your circumstances
> 	- You've managed to turn tough situations around and make something good out of them and make it clear that you're in your current position because you wanted to.
> - The "life happens to me" is a major red flag. ==Don't try to be defensive.== Always try to give a solution, even if it's not correct. The key here is your will to get things done. Show initiative by owning your career narrative and showing that you're learning.

## Your story
- You know it's time to tell a story when the question is asking about the past or your background (e.g. questions that start with "_**tell** me why/how/about..._). For these type of questions, ==it is crucial that you craft your narrative so that your story finds common ground with their interests and includes details that align with their needs==. _**Bridge the gap, be relevant_** to what they're looking for.  
- The crux of such questions is to see ==how _**you**_ can be _particularly useful_ for their team/company== (i.e. to see if you're gonna be an asset or a liability). At least 50% of your narrative should be about their benefits.
- The point of a story is to pique their interest, give them _just enough_ to make them want more and so that they'll ask more questions to know about the details (which you already expected and prepared for).
	- Again, the key message that you have to deliver is and always will be =="_**What's in it for them?**_"==. Pivot your narrative so that when you finished telling your story, they will want to have you for their benefits.
- The formula: _**Set the stage**_ with `relevant background` → (optional but highly recommended) `compliment/acknowledgement` about their products/achievements/work environment → your `specific engaging/impressive details` about your work/achievements (ideally list them out, start with `let me give you an example`) → wrap up with your `key message`.
	- No more than 2 sentences for each of those ideas. Keep it short and simple, straight to the point with an engaging attitude. Smile.
	- As you're telling your story, it's highly recommend to ==give them the context== **_before_** you put in the work and then emphasize how your work **has _transformed_** the product/campaign/etc...Ideally, you'd want your impact to be _measurable_ (in numbers)
- For example:
	- Q: **_Tell me about yourself_** or _**Why do you want to work here**_. Notice that the underlying questions here are "who are you?", "what's your background?", "why are you here?", "how are you gonna help us?" 
	- A: _I'm a CS grad from `HCMUE`, and I just love building stuff on both sides of an app - you know, `making everything work together nicely`. At FPT Telecom, that's exactly what I got to do with `React and Node.js`. Actually, we had this pretty cool project where we launched a `Cloudflare product that got something like 50,000 users in just a week`! That really showed me what good development can do, and I'd be `excited to bring that kind of energy to what you're working on here at Acme`._
## Screening
- Typically lasts *under an hour*. [[Screening|Checkout]] what kind of questions you should be expecting.
- Usually starts with self introduction. First impression is important. Cultivate that.
- Do not spend too long ($\leqslant$ 3mins ) on your self introduction as you will have less time left to code.
- Go in this order: 
	1. Current Role, current work responsibility
	2. College: my background is in computer science. I did my undergrad at HCMUE and...
	3. Post College: Internship, isolation
	4. Current Role: after college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined FPT as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about...
	5. Outside of Work: a bit about hobbies, adventurous,...
	6. Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company came up. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to be a part of a great team.
## Technical
>[!important]- Never memorize the solution
> - You're a problem solver, capable of adapting and generalizing your solutions, not bound to any specific problem. Be water, my friend.
- Coding questions tend to be vague and underspecified on purpose to allow the interviewer to gauge the candidate's attention to detail and carefulness. Ask at least 2-3 clarifying questions, something like:
	- Will the input only have integers, or could there be other types?
	- Will the input be sorted or unsorted?
	- Is the input guaranteed to have elements or could it be empty?
	- What's the expected input size?
	- What should I do if an invalid input is given?
> Make sure you understand **exactly** what they are asking. Do not ignore any piece of information given.
- Your initial approach should be discussing with the interviewer and verify that your interpretation of the problem is on the right track with [pseudo code](https://www.interviewkickstart.com/learn/how-to-write-pseudocode) (the simplest form can be just a text-based line-by-line description that details the requirements). 
- You should be vocal about every solution that you could think of (don't go too much into implementation details just yet), then *narrow down and explain why you're elected one approach over another* (including analysis of the time and space complexity, and you'd prefer choosing the one with *lower time complexity*).
- Discuss the tradeoffs of each approach with your interviewer ==as if the interviewer was your coworker and you all are collaborating on a problem==.
> [!danger] Show potential
> - Coding interview rounds are there to assess fundamental knowledge, capability, and _**learning potential**_.
> - The more vocal you are, the easier it is for the interviewer to help you. If you can't capitalize on that, then it's skill issue.
> - Ask clarifying questions that show your integrity, ==**_collaboration_**==, and ability to be resourceful. Use language like "_how does that sound to you_", or "_is that sufficient_", etc. makes them feel included and helps them imagine collaborating with you in real life when you have the job.
> - If they are giving you a hint, it is because they want you to succeed. It is **extremely** important that you are receptive to what the interviewer says at this stage.
> - It doesn't matter how well you did on the technical portion if the interviewer doesn't like you in the end. After all, it's the human that you're working with, not the machines.
- If the problem appears too hard to even come up with pseudo code, walk through the brute force solution (**while acknowledging** that it is a suboptimal solution) then look for areas to narrow down the goal and optimize it.
- Even if you can't come up with the code or DSA, don't fret. Always strive to demonstrate your reasoning and the follow the [[Technical#Best practices|best practices]] that you know of. *When possible, always use code that has been shown to be effective. Don't try to reinvent the wheel.*
> Solve the problem **conceptually** first → Use the appropriate tools/DSA → Optimize the solution.

## Behavioral
- Typically, behavioral interview [questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions) can be split into several types:
	- Getting to know your career preferences, ambitions and plans
	- Discuss [[Progressive Overload#Behavioral - What to tell |the details]] of experiences or projects written in your resume
	- "_Tell me about a time where you..._" type of questions where you describe how you demonstrated certain traits or responded to a situation
- Display pride in previous work-related experiences you've had. And have some questions [[You as an interviewer|prepared]]. Take this time to learn something about what is being sought.
- Prepare your stories to [[Behavioral|showcase fit]] to the company's culture / core values.
- Refrain from exaggerating your abilities or being negative towards yourself.
> Do whatever it takes to not sound desperate, even if you are.
- Rather than saying "I failed at that task", you could say that task was challenging but provided me with some ideas for future areas of research to explore.
- Additionally, avoid excessive slang cursing or inappropriate humor.

## Benefits & negotiation
- Scout your target company and get intel on (ideally through networking):
	- How long they've been trying to hire for that position
	- Identify the growth pain points of the company
- Startups usually offer a bit higher for fresh graduate ($120,000 - $130,000) to make up for the lack of liquidity of the equity grant (not yet real cash).
- Ideally, you should have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible (==at least 2 from tier-2 companies before== getting an offer from your Tier-1 companies). This will maximize your window for negotiating:
	- "I've received another offer from `OTHER CORP` that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of `YOUR COMPANY` and think that it would overall be a better fit for me."
	- Of course you can ==ask to extend existing offers== to prolong the competition between offers.  
- Your first answer to the salary question should be: "Based on what we've been through, and the compatibility between my abilities and your requirement for this position, what's the highest offer that you can give ?"
- If they can't give you a number, try these: 
	- "I understand, of course - times are tough. And I agree that for an average candidate, the budget would definitely be a good place to start. However, as I showed you in the interview process, _I fully intend to make an **above average contribution**_, and I think I’ve demonstrated a track record for doing that. So I’d simply ask that the compensation reflect that.” 
	- "I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team."
	- ==After you've stated your point, just STFU and wait for their turn==.
> [!info]- Healthy conflict
> It turns them on to see that you dare to put yourself in a higher position (tactfully)  
### Concession
- If you notice that they're giving ambiguous answers (i.e. no specific number or range has been mentioned) some back-and-forth discussion, well, that means it's time for you to reveal your desired number (*not* range), based on these guidelines:
	- If you honestly think you absolutely nailed that interview ($\geqslant$ 96,69%), give out the *highest* number in the market for that position.
	- If the interview was like, meh...(5 to 8 out of 10), try to negotiate with the aim of increasing 30%-50% from your current salary.
	- If the interview was ***not*** on your side, but you still really want to work there (maybe you spotted someone great to learn from), try to negotiate with the aim of maximum 30% increase from your current salary.
	- An example to give your number: "_I totally understand your position and I’m flexible. On the other hand, I really do want to walk away from this with a number that’s a little bit closer to what I had in mind. Would it be fair if we met halfway at `your number`?_"
- ==You should **not** reveal to companies what you're currently making.==
- It's better to have a *specific* "Ask": It's more effective to ask for an additional  `$6996`  in salary than to just ask for "more" or give the range.
- Negotiate other benefits from the compensation package and company culture which may make up for a low/undesirable income, such as:
	- **Early performance reviews**: If they say something along the lines of "_We absolutely have no more budget for this. We’re at the top of our budget_...", here's how you come back:
		- "Look, I intend on going above and beyond this job description. I want to _write into my contract_ that we’re going to check back in in 6 months. By that time, we will have achieved this, this and this together, and if so, I think that this means that it’s a little bit of a bigger role and we’ll have to reevaluate comp at that juncture."
	- **Delayed start date** (reframe it as 2-week/4-week unpaid vacation)
- **Annual Bonus**: Annual bonuses at tech companies can range from anywhere from 3% to 30%. Your recruiter might reveal the average annual bonus, but if not, check with friends at the company.
- [Equity/stock](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation). Read [more](https://gist.github.com/yossorion/4965df74fd6da6cdc280ec57e83a202d).
- Consider the "happiness" factor: 
	- **Healthy oncall as a priority**: Is the oncall load manageable?
	- The Product: are they crafting art of just getting shit done ?
	- Manager and teammates: it's best to directly meet them and ask about their impression on the job/company
	- Company Culture: how decisions get made, to the social atmosphere, to how the company is organized. Ask your future teammates how they would describe the culture.
	- Work hours: work life balance, is OT well compensated or is the company expecting you to be ready for the job at all time ? 
> [!warning]- Asking for perks
> - If you're negotiating for _**your**_ benefits, be very clear that it's _**about you**_, not other coworkers, not anyone else. Don't try to be a martyr when it comes to _**your benefits**_.
> - Also make it very clear that you're gonna be a top performer **because of** those perks that you asked for (ideally, support your claims with tangible execution plans)
- Choose companies/teams that resonate with what you value. The aim of an interview is to find a good match between the company and the candidate.
- Despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out.
> Try to notice something good about them at a personal level, then give them an honest praise for that. Don't expect anything from them, just give a simple, heartfelt praise.

# After the interview
- Interviewers assess you *relative to other candidates* on that same question by the same interviewer. It's a *relative* comparison.
- If you haven't heard back from a company within ***3 - 5*** business days after your interview, check in (politely) with your recruiter.
- Establishing a friendly, engaging conversation with your interviewers is your ticket to future job offers.
- If you're still waiting to hear back from other companies, you can ask for an extension. Usually these deadlines are one to four weeks out
- Rejected, ask for feedback like: "Is there anything you'd suggest I work on for next time?". If you comeback to give it another shot, ask: "What are some of the most impressive achievements of your team/company for the last `x` months (since our last meeting) ?"
