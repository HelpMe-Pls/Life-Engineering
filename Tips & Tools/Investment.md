# Leverages
- We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. 
- All leverages lie in ==taking action==, not in hesitation.
- Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.
- To invest is to use ***leverages*** to scale existing assets/businesses.
## Capital
- The easiest and most straightforward leverage is money. Money begets more money. You do that by saving, specifically, lending your money to earn the passive income from interest.
- The rich aren’t using compound interest to get wealthy; they’re using it for income, liquidity, and capital deployment. A 5% tax-free yield on $10MM suddenly creates a $500M per year passive income.
- If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people.
## Expertise - labor
- You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn’t know how to get elsewhere. A lot of people think you can go to school and study for how to make money, but the reality is, there’s no skill called “business.”
- Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.
- Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input,  that’s the dream.
## Products that have no marginal cost of replication
- These are digital products (in the essence of code and media). The best of all is probably software, especially SaaS.
- By distributing software, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.
- They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.
## Scale 
- Scale is achieved in reach (units sold) and/or magnitude (unit profit).
- Tiny habitats create tiny wealth. Think big, nationally, and internationally. Increase the pool size for your customers.
- Digital products and their accessibility via internet is key to increase scale.
- If you can’t be the source of scale, try to get very close to the source and serve it. 
	- For example, you, by yourself don't have direct access to millions of consumers in the world, but if you can leverage social media, you now have the accessibility which it offers.
- With iteration and distribution, scale is conquered.
