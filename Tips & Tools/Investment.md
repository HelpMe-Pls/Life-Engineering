# Leverages
- To invest is to use ***leverages*** to scale existing assets/businesses.
## Money
- The easiest and most straightforward leverage is money. Money begets more money. You do that by saving, specifically, lending your money to earn the passive income from interest.
- The rich aren’t using compound interest to get wealthy; they’re using it for income, liquidity, and capital deployment. A 5% tax-free yield on $10MM suddenly creates a $500M per year passive income.
