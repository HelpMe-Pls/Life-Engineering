# Writing
- Generally, 2 to 4 paragraphs is the sweet spot for an 8+ band, in terms of length (of course you must also be mindful of the minimum of 150 words for task 1 (the ideal is 180~220 words) and 250~300 words for task 2).
- It is very important to *separate your content ideas into clear paragraphs* so that the examiner can see them immediately.
- The tasks last 20 minutes for task 1 and 40 minutes for task 2. Coordinate your execution accordingly.
- In any case, your "padding" to the details should feel realistic, tangible and ==***relevant***==, rather than some made up statistics or being too dramatic or too many unnecessary specific details.
## Task 1
- This test requires you to think very carefully about ***the recipient*** (the person reading the letter) ***the content*** (the ideas and details you create) and ***the style*** of the writing.
	- If the IELTS examiner thinks you are confused about the recipient and the style, and if your content does not answer the task properly, you will get a low score – even if your English is quite good.
	- Don’t invent too many complicated details about the situation, *even if you know a lot about the topic*. Try to ==keep the details quite simple==.
### Get this right
- There are 3 critical points to focus on for this task:
	- The *imaginary* ***recipient*** of the letter (a stranger or someone you know personally)
	- The correct ***style*** to use (personal, formal or semi-formal)
	- The ***content*** of the letter (a typical *mix* of expressions: ==complaining, requesting, explaining/apologizing, suggesting==)
> Ask yourself, "**Why** am I writing this letter? What **combination** of content do I need to create?"
- How to map them out (within the first ==3 minutes==):
	- **Recipient**: 
		- Semi Stranger - formal / semi-formal (you can recognize this style if the question mentions "*the relevant person*" or someone specific, e.g. the store manager, the governor,...): "Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. `firstName`,..."
		- Complete Stranger - formal (usually for *complaining/requesting* for a service offered by *an organization*): "Dear Sir or Madam,..."
		- Someone you know personally - personal/semi-formal: "Dear `firstName`,"
	- **Content**: read the prompt *very carefully* (specifically the part after "In your letter,...") and you should ==recognize the required *mix* of expressions you ***must*** include. You ***must not*** mention any expression that *isn't* in the requirement== (e.g. a seemingly polite "apologizing for contacting the recipient" _would be **invalid**_ if the prompt doesn't explicitly state that you should apologize)
		- **Complaining**: a letter of complaint to a business, requesting and suggesting are often similar in content, in *formal* style. You're expected to give a replacement/repair/immediate refund request if it's about a product. 
			- Start with "*I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with*....". Try to craft your sentences in a contrast manner between `your expectation` and `your issue` (e.g. "*Although the headphones worked flawlessly in-store, their noise-cancelling function was noticeably ineffective when I used them in a local coffee shop.*"). For padding: "*I am confident that your offer is good enough to keep my custom*." End it with a "Kind regards,".
		- **Requesting**: this should be in a polite but firm tone, e.g. "*I would appreciate it if you could...*". Use indirect questions to begin a request for help or information (e.g. "*I wonder if you could send me the course details urgently, as I wish to apply very soon.*")
- The general structure:
	1. Greeting (1 line): pay very close attention to the question, it should tell you something like =="Begin your letter ‘Dear --------’"==
	2. First paragraph: An overview of "what is this about", addressing the first required expression
	3. Second paragraph: The meat (a hint of "how do you *feel* about it/how does it *affect* you, could help), extending the first required expression and focus on the second required expression.
	4. Third paragraph: Extra meat (but still meat, don't go veggie here), extending the previous expressions and focus on the final required expression. Remember that these 3 paragraphs don't have to be in the same length.
	5. Closing (3 lines: CTA → farewell → your name)
#### Tips
- **For formal style**: use formal words such as "regarding, remains, considerable, commotion, appreciate, restrict,..."
	- ==**Don't** use contractions== (e.g. don’t, can’t, shouldn't,...) 
	- Use formal phrases:
		- I am writing regarding...
		- I am sure you will appreciate that...
		- May I suggest that...
		- I therefore request that you...
		- Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
	- Write in a calm and professional manner, show appreciation (with a positive comment regarding the topic) where appropriate.
	- ==Keep your emotions to a minimum==.
	- For apologizing: use phrases like "Please accept my apologies for this...", "On behalf of everyone concerned, I would like to offer apologies for this...". ==For padding, use: "I was very concerned when I realized that our misunderstanding caused you such inconvenience."==
- **For semi-formal style**:
	- **Don't** use "Dear Sir or Madam,"
	- Use these phrases:
		- Why don’t we... / How about...
		- If I were you, I’d...
		- Do you remember when we...
		- Here’s an idea...
		- The thing / the problem is that...
		- I’m really sorry that...
		- As you will appreciate... (it's a better way of saying "I am sure you can understand that...")
		- Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday (*not* ‘I look forward,’ which is formal)
	- ==The distinction between formal and semi-formal==:
		- Formal: the recipient *is senior* to you in age or authority, is not obliged to follow your suggestions (e.g. something like "I hope it will be acceptable if..." is preferable), or you're complaining or insisting on something.
		- Semi-formal: the recipient is *probably not* senior to you, and you're inquiring some kind of explanation or expressing an interest.
	- If you're not really sure if the style should be formal or personal, the safe bet is to go formal.
	- ==Remember that formal and personal letter tasks are way more common than semi-formal letter tasks.==
- **For personal style**:
	- You can recognize this style if the question has the word "friend" in it.
	- Should begin with "Dear + `firstName`". ***Never*** open with "Dear friend".
	- Showing your feelings is actually recommended for this type of letter.
	- It's ok to make a small joke. Remember, just _**one** small joke_. Don't over do this.
	- You're free to use contractions, phrasal verbs and informal vocabulary (because they're less serious, indicating that you're trying to be friendly and "on the same level"). Words like "really, pretty, kind of,..." are acceptable.
	- ==For checking in, use "*I hope all is going well for you in...*" instead of "*How's it going in...*"==
	- Using the "zero conditional" (`If` + `present simple` + `can` → "*If you let me know the arrival time, I can meet you in my car.*") or "first conditional" (`If` + `present tense` + `will` → "*If you send out the party invitations, I’ll bring all the food*.") is a good way to *make requests or suggestions*.
	- For apologizing: keep it short and simple: "forgive me", "sorry". ==Use this: "If it’s any comfort, I feel terrible about it too." in case you want padding.==
- **For endings**: 
	- Formal recipient CTA: use "I look forward to + `V-ing (NOT hearing)`...", "I would appreciate your reply with...", "Thank you for your help/consideration, and I await...".
	- Formal recipient farewell: use "Kind regard***s***, / Yours sincerely, / Yours faithfully,".
	- Formal and semi-formal recipient: finish with your `firstName lastName`.
	- Personal CTA: "Do let me know...", "Please get in touch...", "I can’t wait to..."
	- Personal farewell: use "All the best, `\n yourFirstName`."
		- Alternatives for "All the best,": Very best wishes, / Take care, / See you soon, / Thinking of you, / Keep in touch,.
	- Always ==use your real first name + surname== in the way it appears on your IELTS candidate paper. Don’t use an imaginary name at the end, because this makes the letter unrealistic.
	- CTA: remember to express appreciation if your content is *requesting* something:
		- Formal: =="*Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated,== and I look forward to your response.*"
	- Don't add anything to your name (i.e. the last line of your letter should only contain your name, no matter what style it is).
	- ==The last character ***must not*** be a full stop (.)==
	- Never use "PS" in a formal letter. It's the last ditch effort for a *personal* letter *if* it's not meeting the minimum length of 150 words.  

> [!important]- Never include your opinions or ideas about topics or trends in society. For this task, it's considered "padding", which heavily reduces your score.
- **About numbers**: don't write numbers in numeric format unless you're describing a universally expected numeric format, like date (September $6^{th}$, 1969), currency ($69,96), room number (room 69), a page of a book (page 96),...
	- **Don't** use the dot (.) for decimal point, use the comma instead.
	- Use the hyphen when the number is multi-digit (e.g. twenty-five years old)
##### Time allocation
- Spend no more than 5 minutes (ideally within the first 3 minutes) to analyze and make notes about the required recipient, style, and content details.
- Finish your letter in about 10 minutes, aiming for about 200 words.
- Finally, spend about 5 minutes checking your letter for mistakes and paraphrasing.

## Task 2
- Use ==***cohesion***== in such a way that it attracts no attention. The linking / transition between sentences and paragraphs should help with the ==development== of ideas but *does ==**not*** overshadow== the ideas.
- Present a fully developed position in ==answer to the question== with ***relevant***, fully extended and well supported ideas.
- ***MOST IMPORTANT***: The taken position should be *clear **throughout*** the essay (i.e. presented in the introduction, and then supported in the rest of the essay, with ==no surprises / unexpected turn in the conclusion==).
### The topics
#### Opinion
- This is the most common prompt for the task. The question is "...do ***==you== agree or disagree***?" 
- You can either strongly or *partly* agree/disagree. Take a clear, definitive position rather than offering an ambiguous/irrelevant response.

> [!important]- Partly agree/disagree
> - Use "On one hand..." to start the first paragraph, and "However..." or "On the other hand..." to start the second paragraph. 
> - Be careful with "extreme" questions, e.g. those with strong claim such as "most important...", "absolute...", "totally...", especially where it ends **without** the "To what extend...". If you choose to disagree, then your answer should carry ==**equal**== weight to the question's subject matter.

> [!danger] Get the topic right
In the end, it's still your ***personal*** take on the subject, so you must **avoid** impersonal language like "**It** is believed...", "**It** is considered..."

> [!info]- Counterarguments
> If you feel like you need to include a counterargument (as an example), do so in a way that further reinforce your answer, ***not*** as a way to support that counterargument.
> Your answer to the topic should behave as a counter to those counterarguments.
#### Discussion
- The question is "Discuss ==***both*** views== and give ***your*** opinion."
- This is basically a [[#Opinion |partly]] agree/disagree prompt, but for social topics, rather than personal views.
> If you can't pick a side, then you must give the 2 arguments equal weight.

> [!danger] Get the topic right
> - The discussion focuses on the use of "they" or other ==***plural pronouns***==. 
> - The key to differentiate between a Discussion and an Opinion question is the pronoun it mentions.
> - Make sure that your claim is still personal, i.e. "I believe that...", "I personally prefer..."
#### Cause/problem and Solution
- The question is "What **problems**/**issues**...", "Suggest some measures..."
- First paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various issues. For example: "...several related problems can be anticipated."
	- Next sentences: extend 2 prominent issues. Elaborate *why* they are considered issues, what's wrong with them, and give example (optional)
- Second paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various solutions. For example: "There are several resolutions to alleviate..."
	- Next sentences: corresponding solutions to the issues *mentioned in the first paragraph*. Optionally, you can add a general solution to the prompt's question or something like: "While there's no silver bullet to/for `the issue`, I’m confident that with dedication and integrity, we can steadily make progress and alleviate the difficulties.
#### Two-part Question
- The prompt's structure: a claim + first question about the prompt + second question about the claim (or follow up to the first question)
- The introduction: 
	- First sentence: *paraphrase* the given topic.
	- Second sentence: further extend/acknowledge the claim/the questions (i.e. it's ok to not answer the questions *yet*), or you can answer both questions in this 1 sentence.
- First paragraph: answer the first question, then further explain and reinforce your answers. Give examples where possible.
- Second paragraph: same thing, for the second question.
### The structure
#### The introduction
- Ideal length: 2 sentences. This is the same for all topics, except for the "two-part question" type.
	- **First sentence**: you can either *paraphrase* the given topic or *mention other perspective* on the topic. For example:
		- Paraphrasing: "Governments should financially support businesses which are facing the possibility of going bankrupt."  → "It is of great necessity for governments to provide financial aids for businesses which are coping with the possibility of bankruptcy."
		- Alternative viewpoints: use phrases like "Considering that perception is subjective...", "People have different views with regard to...",  "Given that perspectives differ..."
	- **Last sentence**: explicitly answer the given question in a concise, direct manner. Use phrases like: "It strikes ***me*** that...", "In ***my*** view...", "***I*** firmly believe that...". For example, when applying to a [[#Opinion |partly]] agree/disagree opinion:
		- "While this..., I *believe* in general..." 
		- "While I agree/disagree that..., I am confident that..."
> Never include any question here.
#### The body
- Ideally 2 paragraphs (so that you qualify the time constraint), 4-6 sentences each. For a paragraph:
	- **First sentence**: introduce your take on the issue.
	- **Next sentence**: clarify / extend your take (*why* do you think that...)
	- **Next 1-2 sentences**: give specific examples/explanations to support your claim
	- **Last 1-2 sentences**: reaffirm *how* those examples strengthen your claim.
- For the first sentence of the *second* paragraph, it should demonstrate either a smooth transition from the first paragraph, or expressing a counterargument (base on the requirement).
#### The conclusion
- Always start with "In conclusion,..."
- ==***Reaffirm*** your answer in the introduction by paraphrasing / extending it==.
### Tips
- Spend *under* 10 minutes on planning when the timer starts. Get your topic right and map out the intended structure (e.g. what should your first and second paragraph discuss about)
- Spend no more than 30 minutes on actually writing the essay. Take note of sentences that need paraphrasing as you write.
	- Introduction: under 5 minutes
	- Each paragraph of the body: no more than 8 minutes
	- Conclusion: less than 4 minutes
- If you're doing great, you should have less than 5 minutes to:
	- ***Check for errors*** (grammatical and syntax)
	- Paraphrase noted sentences. ==**Avoid perfectionism**==. 

## Things to NEVER do
- Avoid questions of any form, *especially in the introduction*.
- Never use idioms, clichés, proverbs, slang or text abbreviations in any type of letter:
	- Common clichés *to avoid*: 
		- At the end of the day...
		- Second of all...
		- Last but not least...
		- To cut a long story short... / In short.../ In a nutshell...
		- To sum up... / To summarize... / In summary....
		- All things considered....
		- I look forward **to hearing** from you.
	- Try to explain yourself clearly without using proverbs, e.g. you can replace the "Too many cooks spoil the broth" proverb with: 
		- Formal voice: "I am worried that the team is too large and so the decision-making is slow."
		- Personal voice: "There are too many people involved these days, and so not much is really getting done."
	- Words like "a nerd/a geek/a creep" or "awesome/cool/wicked/sick" are considered slang.  don't use names for streets, buildings,... in your native language (e.g. Bến Nhà Rồng → Dragon House Harbor). If there is no direct translation, just create a suitable English name, e.g. "There is a big festival here called the National Spring Festival."
- Don't use quotes. Quotations are marked as "memorized language", which heavily deducts your score.
- Don't invent statistics, especially numeric statistics. Rather than relying on invented statistics, focus on expressing your own views.

# Speaking
- Practice speaking your thoughts aloud.
- A little bit of "how do you *feel* about it / how does it *affect* you" could help.
> Never stray away from the main topic that you're discussing.
- They expect you to speak in a manner that poses no difficulty in understanding what you're saying.
- Initiate your voice from your chest, not from your throat. Speak clearly with natural intonation and stress.
- Communicate in a clear and controlled manner. This is who you are. Express with a positive, engaging attitude.
---
# Reading
- It's better to answer fewer questions correctly than to rush through all of them making careless mistakes.
	- Make sure to get the easy ones right, and *make **educated** guesses* for the harder ones.
	- It's always better to have an answer for every question than to leave some blank.
- This is the battle of paraphrasing. Read your question *carefully*, identify its *main* topic of discussion (i.e. what's this about) and then appropriately apply these strategies:
## Strategies
- These are the essential skills for every section that should (but not always) be applied in order:
	1. **Skimming**: your goal is to *get a general idea* of the content and structure of "the text below".
	2. **Scanning**: you must be able to *locate* the relevant part from "the text below" and the (possibly paraphrased) keywords of the statement.
	3. **Close reading**: make sure to clearly identify its *main* topic of discussion.
- ==Spend no more than 2 minutes for each answer.==
### TFNG
- There's always ==***at least one***== "True", one "False" and one "Not Given".
- Aim to complete this task within a 10-minute window. 
> [!info] Tackle the statements in order
> The order of the statements are usually mapped to the order of the paragraphs.
- Follow these steps *in order*:
	1. **Skim** the questions and the text quickly (1-2 minutes): note main topics of each *paragraph* (in 5 words or less).
	2. **Closely read** the statements carefully (1-2 minutes per statement): this is where the "paraphrasing" takes place.
	3. **Predict** your answer (10 seconds): formulate your answer before going back to the paragraphs.
	4. **Scan** for key words (30 seconds per statement): ***locate*** the relevant paragraph topic (that you noted in step 1), then ***locate*** the relevant ***keywords*** in the statement and keep your eyes for those (*possibly paraphrased*) keywords in the filtered passage excerpt.
	5. Make your decision and move on (==do **not** spend more than 2 minutes in total for each statement==): if unsure, mark it as "Not Given".
	6. Review (if you finished within 10 minutes): watch for qualifying words (all, some, never, always)
#### How to identify a "NOT GIVEN"
- A **NOT GIVEN** means the passage _**lacks** the information_ necessary to either *agree or disagree* with the statement.
	- Don’t assume based on your lexical knowledge. Focus on the statement only: is the identified passage answer directly to the statement or not.
	- The excerpt may seem true, but it's not strong enough to completely gravitate toward the claim in the statement → ==the statement *must* either confirm or deny it==. 
- For example: 
	- The statement: "Khoi is 25 years old."
	- The excerpt: "Khoi is a mature person."
### The order of execution
- Complete the sections in their numerical order.
- Complete your question types in this order:
	1. Matching: Header → Information (paragraph/feature) matching, mostly require skimming and scanning
	2. Fill in the blank
	3. Multiple choice
	4. TFNG
---
# Listening
- Listen carefully to differentiate between similar characters (`b` vs `p`, `m` vs `n`) when the track is spelling.
- Listen carefully to the pronunciation to detect the correct form (singular/plural, tenses,...)
- Again, this is the battle of paraphrasing. Read your question *carefully*, identify its *main* topic of discussion (i.e. what's this about), identify the keywords, recognize the synonyms.
>  Don't spend too much time on a question that you miss the remaining part of the track.

> [!important]- Memorize the track
> - If it takes more than 10s to answer the question, mark it for later and focus on the remaining of the track.
> - It's always better to ==memorize the key topic== of the conversations in the track, and then recall that to answer your questions, rather than lingering on the questions and try to get them right while the track is still running.
