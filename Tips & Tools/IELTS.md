# Writing
- Generally, 3 to 4 paragraphs is the sweet spot for an 8+ band, in terms of length (of course you must also be mindful of the minimum of 150 words for task 1 and 250 words for task 2).
- It is very important to *separate your content ideas into clear paragraphs* so that the examiner can see them immediately.
- The tasks last 20 minutes for task 1 and 40 minutes for task 2. Coordinate your execution accordingly.
- In any case, your "padding" to the details should feel realistic, tangible and relevant, rather than some made up statistics or being too dramatic or too many unnecessary specific details.
## Task 1
- This test requires you to think very carefully about the recipient (the person reading the letter) the content (the ideas and details you create) and the style of the writing.
	- If the IELTS examiner thinks you are confused about the recipient and the style, and if your content does not answer the task properly, you will get a low score – even if your English is quite good.
### Get this right
- There are 3 critical points to focus on for this task:
	- The *imaginary* ***recipient*** of the letter (a stranger or someone you know personally)
	- The correct ***style*** to use (personal, formal or semi-formal)
	- The ***content*** of the letter (a typical *mix* of expressions: complaining, requesting, explaining/apologizing, suggesting)
> Ask yourself, ‘**Why** am I writing this letter? What **combination** of content do I need to create?’
- How to map them out (within the first ==3 minutes==):
	- Recipient: 
		- Semi Stranger - formal: "Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. `Name`,..."
		- Complete Stranger - formal: "Dear Sir or Madam,..."
		- Someone you know personally - personal/semi-formal: "Hey/Hi `Name`,"
	- Content: read the prompt *very carefully* (specifically the part after "In your letter,...") and you should recognize the required *mix* of expressions you ***must*** include. ==You ***must not*** mention any expression that isn't in the requirement== (e.g. a seemingly polite "apologizing for contacting the recipient" *would be **invalid*** if the prompt doesn't explicitly state that you should apologize)
- The general structure:
	1. Greeting (1 line)
	2. First paragraph: An overview of "what is this about", addressing the first required expression
	3. Second paragraph: The meat (a hint of "how do you *feel* about it/how does it *affect* you, could help), extending the first required expression and focus on the second required expression.
	4. Third paragraph: Extra meat (but still meat, don't go veggie here), extending the previous expressions and focus on the final required expression.
	5. Closing (3 lines: looking forward → farewell → your name)
#### Tips
- For greetings:
	- f
	- f
	- f
- For formal style: use formal words such as "regarding, remains, considerable, commotion, appreciate, restrict,..."
	- **Don't** use contractions (e.g. don’t, can’t, shouldn't,...)
	- Use formal phrases:
		- I am writing regarding...
		- I am sure you will appreciate that...
		- May I suggest that...
		- I therefore request that you...
		- Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
		
	- Write in a calm and professional manner, show appreciation (with a positive comment regarding the topic) where appropriate.
- For semi-formal style:
	- f
	- Use these phrases:
		- Why don’t we... / How about...
		- If I were you, I’d...
		- Do you remember when we...
		- Here’s an idea!
		- The thing / the problem is that...
		- I’m really sorry that...
		- Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday (*not* ‘I look forward,’ which is formal)
	- f
	- 
- For personal style:
	- Should begin with "Dear + `firstName`"
	- f
- For endings: 
	- Senior recipient: use "Kind regards / Yours Sincerely / Yours Faithfully" 
	- For formal recipient: use "I look forward to + `V-ing`"
	- For personal recipient: finish with a friendly comment and "All the best, `\n yourFirstName`."
		- Alternatives for "All the best": Very best wishes/Take care/See you soon/Thinking of you / Keep in touch.
> [!important]- Never include your opinions or ideas about topics or trends in society. For this task, it's considered "padding", which heavily reduces your score.

## Task 2
- f
- f
## Things to NEVER do
- Never use idioms, clichés, proverbs, slang or text abbreviations in any type of letter:
	- Common clichés *to avoid*: 
		- At the end of the day
		- Second of all
		- Last but not least
		- To cut a long story short / In a nutshell
		- I look forward to hearing from you
	- Try to explain yourself clearly without using proverbs, e.g. you can replace the "Too many cooks spoil the broth" proverb with: 
		- Formal voice: "I am worried that the team is too large and so the decision-making is slow."
		- Personal voice: "There are too many people involved these days, and so not much is really getting done."
	- Words like "a nerd/a geek/a creep" or "awesome/cool/wicked/sick" are considered slang.

# Speaking
- Practice speaking your thoughts aloud.
- A little bit of "how do you *feel* about it / how does it *affect* you" could help.
> Never stray away from the main topic that you're discussing.
- They expect you to speak in a manner that poses no difficulty in understanding what you're saying.
- Initiate your voice from your chest, not from your throat.
- Communicate in a clear and controlled manner. This is who you are. Express with a positive, engaging attitude.
