# Writing
- Generally, 3 to 4 paragraphs is the sweet spot for an 8+ band, in terms of length (of course you must also be mindful of the minimum of 150 words for task 1 (the ideal is 180~220 words) and 250 words for task 2).
- It is very important to *separate your content ideas into clear paragraphs* so that the examiner can see them immediately.
- The tasks last 20 minutes for task 1 and 40 minutes for task 2. Coordinate your execution accordingly.
- In any case, your "padding" to the details should feel realistic, tangible and ==***relevant***==, rather than some made up statistics or being too dramatic or too many unnecessary specific details.
## Task 1
- This test requires you to think very carefully about the recipient (the person reading the letter) the content (the ideas and details you create) and the style of the writing.
	- If the IELTS examiner thinks you are confused about the recipient and the style, and if your content does not answer the task properly, you will get a low score – even if your English is quite good.
	- Don’t invent too many complicated details about the situation, *even if you know a lot about the topic*. Try to ==keep the details quite simple==.
### Get this right
- There are 3 critical points to focus on for this task:
	- The *imaginary* ***recipient*** of the letter (a stranger or someone you know personally)
	- The correct ***style*** to use (personal, formal or semi-formal)
	- The ***content*** of the letter (a typical *mix* of expressions: ==complaining, requesting, explaining/apologizing, suggesting==)
> Ask yourself, ‘**Why** am I writing this letter? What **combination** of content do I need to create?’
- How to map them out (within the first ==3 minutes==):
	- Recipient: 
		- Semi Stranger - formal / semi-formal (you can recognize this style if the question mentions "the relevant person"): "Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. `firstName`,..."
		- Complete Stranger - formal (usually for complaining/requesting for a service offered by an organization): "Dear Sir or Madam,..."
		- Someone you know personally - personal/semi-formal: "Dear `firstName`,"
	- Content: read the prompt *very carefully* (specifically the part after "In your letter,...") and you should ==recognize the required *mix* of expressions you ***must*** include. You ***must not*** mention any expression that isn't in the requirement== (e.g. a seemingly polite "apologizing for contacting the recipient" *would be **invalid*** if the prompt doesn't explicitly state that you should apologize)
- The general structure:
	1. Greeting (1 line): pay very close attention to the question, it should tell you something like =="Begin your letter ‘Dear --------’"==
	2. First paragraph: An overview of "what is this about", addressing the first required expression
	3. Second paragraph: The meat (a hint of "how do you *feel* about it/how does it *affect* you, could help), extending the first required expression and focus on the second required expression.
	4. Third paragraph: Extra meat (but still meat, don't go veggie here), extending the previous expressions and focus on the final required expression. Remember that these 3 paragraphs don't have to be in the same length.
	5. Closing (3 lines: CTA → farewell → your name)
#### Tips
- **For formal style**: use formal words such as "regarding, remains, considerable, commotion, appreciate, restrict,..."
	- **Don't** use contractions (e.g. don’t, can’t, shouldn't,...) 
	- Use formal phrases:
		- I am writing regarding...
		- I am sure you will appreciate that...
		- May I suggest that...
		- I therefore request that you...
		- Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
	- Write in a calm and professional manner, show appreciation (with a positive comment regarding the topic) where appropriate.
	- ==Keep your emotions to a minimum==.
	- For apologizing: use phrases like "Please accept my apologies for this...", "On behalf of everyone concerned, I would like to offer apologies for this...". ==For padding, use: "I was very concerned when I realized that our misunderstanding caused you such inconvenience."==
- **For semi-formal style**:
	- **Don't** use "Dear Sir or Madam,"
	- Use these phrases:
		- Why don’t we... / How about...
		- If I were you, I’d...
		- Do you remember when we...
		- Here’s an idea.
		- The thing / the problem is that...
		- I’m really sorry that...
		- As you will appreciate... (it's a better way of saying "I am sure you can understand that...")
		- Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday (*not* ‘I look forward,’ which is formal)
	- ==The distinction between formal and semi-formal==:
		- Formal: the recipient *is senior* to you in age or authority, is not obliged to follow your suggestions (e.g. something like "I hope it will be acceptable if..." is preferable), or you're complaining or insisting on something.
		- Semi-formal: the recipient is *probably not* senior to you, and you're inquiring some kind of explanation or expressing an interest.
	- If you're not really sure if the style should be formal or personal, the safe bet is to go formal.
	- Remember that formal and personal letter tasks are more common than semi-formal letter tasks.
- **For personal style**:
	- Should begin with "Dear + `firstName`". ***Never*** open with "Dear friend"
	- Showing your feelings is actually recommended for this type of letter.
	- It's ok to make a small joke. Remember, just ***one** small joke*. Don't over do this.
	- You're free to use contractions, phrasal verbs and informal vocabulary (because they're less serious, indicating that you're trying to be friendly and "on the same level"). Words like "really, pretty, kind of,..." are acceptable.
	- Using the "zero conditional" (`If` + `present simple` + `can`) or "first conditional" (`If` + `present tense` + `will`) is a good way to *make requests or suggestions*.
	- For apologizing: keep it short and simple: "forgive me", "sorry". ==Use this: "If it’s any comfort, I feel terrible about it too." in case you want padding.==
- **For endings**: 
	- Formal recipient CTA: use "I look forward to + `V-ing`", "I would appreciate your reply with...", "Thank you for your help/consideration, and I await...".
	- Senior recipient farewell: use "Kind **R**egards, / Yours **S**incerely, / Yours **F**aithfully,".
	- Formal and semi-formal recipient: finish with your `firstName lastName`.
	- Personal CTA: "Do let me know...", "Please get in touch...", "I can’t wait to..."
	- Personal recipient: finish with a friendly comment and "All the best, `\n yourFirstName`."
		- Alternatives for "All the best,": Very best wishes, / Take care, / See you soon, / Thinking of you, / Keep in touch,.
	- Always ==use your real first name + surname== in the way it appears on your IELTS candidate paper. Don’t use an imaginary name at the end, because this makes the letter unrealistic.
	- CTA: remember to express appreciation if your content is requesting something.
	- Don't add anything to your name (i.e. the last line of your letter should only contain your name, no matter what style it is).
	- ==The last character ***must not*** be a full stop (.)==
	- Never use "PS" in a formal letter. It's the last ditch effort for a *personal* letter *if* it's not meeting the minimum length of 150 words.  
> [!important]- Never include your opinions or ideas about topics or trends in society. For this task, it's considered "padding", which heavily reduces your score.
- **About numbers**: don't write numbers in numeric format unless you're describing a universally expected numeric format, like date (September $6^{th}$, 1969), currency ($69,96), room number (room 69), a page of a book (page 96),...
	- **Don't** use the dot (.) for decimal point, use the comma instead.
	- Use the hyphen when the number is multi-digit (e.g. twenty-five years old)
##### Time allocation
- Spend no more than 5 minutes (ideally within the first 3 minutes) to analyze and make notes about the required recipient, style, and content details.
- Finish your letter in about 10 minutes, aiming for about 200 words.
- Finally, spend about 5 minutes checking your letter for mistakes and paraphrasing.

## Task 2
- Use ==***cohesion***== in such a way that it attracts no attention. The linking / transition between sentences and paragraphs should help with the ==development== of ideas but *does ==**not*** overshadow== the ideas.
- Present a fully developed position in ==answer to the question== with ***relevant***, fully extended and well supported ideas.
- ***MOST IMPORTANT***: The taken position should be *clear **throughout*** the essay (i.e. presented in the introduction, and then supported in the rest of the essay, with ==no surprises / unexpected turn in the conclusion==).
### The topics
#### Opinion
- This is the most common prompt for the task. The question is "...do ***==you== agree or disagree***?" 
- You can either strongly or *partly* agree/disagree. Take a clear, definitive position rather than offering an ambiguous/irrelevant response.

> [!important]- Partly agree/disagree
> - Use "On one hand..." to start the first paragraph, and "However..." or "On the other hand..." to start the second paragraph. 
> - Be careful with "extreme" questions, e.g. those with strong claim such as "most important...", "absolute...", "totally...", especially where it ends **without** the "To what extend...". If you choose to disagree, then your answer should carry ==**equal**== weight to the question's subject matter.

> [!danger] Get the topic right
In the end, it's still your ***personal*** take on the subject, so you must **avoid** impersonal language like "**It** is believed...", "**It** is considered..."

> [!info]- Counterarguments
> If you feel like you need to include a counterargument (as an example), do so in a way that further reinforce your answer, ***not*** as a way to support that counterargument.
> Your answer to the topic should behave as a counter to those counterarguments.
#### Discussion
- The question is "Discuss ==***both*** views== and give ***your*** opinion."
- This is basically a [[#Opinion |partly]] agree/disagree prompt, but for social topics, rather than personal views.
> If you can't pick a side, then you must give the 2 arguments equal weight.

> [!danger] Get the topic right
> - The discussion focuses on the use of "they" or other ==***plural pronouns***==. 
> - The key to differentiate between a Discussion and an Opinion question is the pronoun it mentions.
> - Make sure that your claim is still personal, i.e. "I believe that...", "I personally prefer..."
#### Cause/problem and Solution
- The question is "What **problems**/**issues**...", "Suggest some measures..."
- First paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various issues. For example: "...several related problems can be anticipated."
	- Next sentences: extend 2 prominent issues. Elaborate *why* they are considered issues, what's wrong with them, and give example (optional)
- Second paragraph:
	- First sentence: introduce various solutions. For example: "There are several resolutions to alleviate..."
	- Next sentences: corresponding solutions to the issues *mentioned in the first paragraph*. Optionally, you can add a general solution to the prompt's question or something like: "While there's no silver bullet to/for `the issue`, I’m confident that with dedication and integrity, we can steadily make progress and alleviate the difficulties.
#### Two-part Question
- The prompt's structure: a claim + first question about the prompt + second question about the claim (or follow up to the first question)
- The introduction: 
	- First sentence: *paraphrase* the given topic.
	- Second sentence: further extend/acknowledge the claim/the questions (i.e. it's ok to not answer the questions *yet*), or you can answer both questions in this 1 sentence.
- First paragraph: answer the first question, then further explain and reinforce your answers. Give examples where possible.
- Second paragraph: same thing, for the second question.
### The structure
#### The introduction
- Ideal length: 2 sentences. This is the same for all topics, except for the "two-part question" type.
	- **First sentence**: you can either *paraphrase* the given topic or *mention other perspective* on the topic. For example:
		- Paraphrasing: "Governments should financially support businesses which are facing the possibility of going bankrupt."  → "It is of great necessity for governments to provide financial aids for businesses which are coping with the possibility of bankruptcy."
		- Alternative viewpoints: use phrases like "Considering that perception is subjective...", "People have different views with regard to...",  "Given that perspectives differ..."
	- **Last sentence**: explicitly answer the given question in a concise, direct manner. Use phrases like: "It strikes ***me*** that...", "In ***my*** view...", "***I*** firmly believe that...". For example, when applying to a [[#Opinion |partly]] agree/disagree opinion:
		- "While this..., I *believe* in general..." 
		- "While I agree/disagree that..., I am confident that..."
> Never include any question here.
#### The body
- Ideally 2 paragraphs (so that you qualify the time constraint), 4-6 sentences each. For a paragraph:
	- **First sentence**: introduce your take on the issue.
	- **Next sentence**: clarify / extend your take (*why* do you think that...)
	- **Next 1-2 sentences**: give specific examples/explanations to support your claim
	- **Last 1-2 sentences**: reaffirm *how* those examples strengthen your claim.
- For the first sentence of the *second* paragraph, it should demonstrate either a smooth transition from the first paragraph, or expressing a counterargument (base on the requirement).
#### The conclusion
- Always start with "In conclusion,..."
- ==***Reaffirm*** your answer in the introduction by paraphrasing / extending it==.
### Tips
- Spend *under* 10 minutes on planning when the timer starts. Get your topic right and map out the intended structure (e.g. what should your first and second paragraph discuss about)
- Spend no more than 30 minutes on actually writing the essay. Take note of sentences that need paraphrasing as you write.
	- Introduction: under 5 minutes
	- Each paragraph of the body: no more than 8 minutes
	- Conclusion: less than 4 minutes
- If you're doing great, you should have less than 5 minutes to:
	- ***Check for errors*** (grammatical and syntax)
	- Paraphrase noted sentences. ==**Avoid perfectionism**==. 

## Things to NEVER do
- Avoid questions of any form, *especially in the introduction*.
- Never use idioms, clichés, proverbs, slang or text abbreviations in any type of letter:
	- Common clichés *to avoid*: 
		- At the end of the day...
		- Second of all...
		- Last but not least...
		- To cut a long story short... / In short.../ In a nutshell...
		- To sum up... / To summarize... / In summary....
		- All things considered....
		- I look forward **to hearing** from you.
	- Try to explain yourself clearly without using proverbs, e.g. you can replace the "Too many cooks spoil the broth" proverb with: 
		- Formal voice: "I am worried that the team is too large and so the decision-making is slow."
		- Personal voice: "There are too many people involved these days, and so not much is really getting done."
	- Words like "a nerd/a geek/a creep" or "awesome/cool/wicked/sick" are considered slang.  don't use names for streets, buildings,... in your native language (e.g. Bến Nhà Rồng → Dragon House Harbor). If there is no direct translation, just create a suitable English name, e.g. "There is a big festival here called the National Spring Festival."
- Don't use quotes. Quotations are marked as "memorized language", which heavily deducts your score.
- Don't invent statistics, especially numeric statistics. Rather than relying on invented statistics, focus on expressing your own views.

# Speaking
- Practice speaking your thoughts aloud.
- A little bit of "how do you *feel* about it / how does it *affect* you" could help.
> Never stray away from the main topic that you're discussing.
- They expect you to speak in a manner that poses no difficulty in understanding what you're saying.
- Initiate your voice from your chest, not from your throat.
- Communicate in a clear and controlled manner. This is who you are. Express with a positive, engaging attitude.
