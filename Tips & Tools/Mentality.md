- Nobody is going to give you permission to do what you want. They don’t have the story that you are telling yourself.
- At the end of the day, no one gives a fuck about you, unless you have some kind of impact (be it positive or negative) on them, or you provoked their insecurities. So why bother? Focus on yourself (and that doesn't mean you should be an uncompassionate person). Realize *the human nature* so that you don't dwell on the negative impacts from others.
- Never compare yourself to others. You're just dosing yourself some copium by doing so. The situation isn't changed. No output. Stay in your lane and keep up progress. There are no limits except for the ones you place on yourself. Shut the fuck up and Execute.
- The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won.
- It is so important to remember when judging success — both your own and others’: “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”
> Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.
- The pain of not achieving your goals must outweigh the pain of living a mediocre life.
- The path out of a low point is trial and error, the essence of life itself.
- To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.
- You can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.
- Self-confidence comes from doing what you think is uncomfortable, over and over again, and realizing it wasn't that bad in the first place.
- Charisma is the ability to project confidence and love at the same time. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive.
- For important decisions, discard memory and identity, and focus on the problem. 
> It’s not about having correct judgment. It’s about avoiding incorrect judgments.
- You aren’t confident because you are trapped in someone else’s story. You don’t have a chance to transform into who you were meant to become.
> When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job.
- There are no limits except for the ones you place on yourself. Practically speaking, you're the only one who can stop yourself and also the only one moving forward. Never compare yourself to someone who seems to effortlessly achieved your goals and then underestimate your abilities. If there's proof that something is humanly possible, you can (partially) make it happen.  
> Simple heuristic: If you’re **evenly** split on a difficult decision, take the path more **painful in the short term**.
- You get somewhere by building genuine relationships:
	- Giving with no intention of receiving in return
	- Acting in the service of others
	- Creating value for those around you
- Humans are emotional beings, not logical. People don’t remember what you say, they remember how you make them feel.
- Live life by design, not default. _Your time is limited,_ **_so don’t waste it living someone else’s life_**. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
> Wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage.
- A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned.
- We think of ourselves as fixed and the world as malleable, but it’s really we who are malleable and the world is largely fixed.
- Try not to attach desire with happiness. Don't let your desire be a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. Realize the area where you've chosen to be unhappy. Choose your desire wisely.
- A happy person isn’t someone who’s happy all the time. It’s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don’t lose their innate peace.
