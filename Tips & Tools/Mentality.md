- Nobody is going to give you permission to do what you want. They don’t have the story that you are telling yourself.
- At the end of the day, no one gives a fuck about you, unless you have some kind of impact (be it positive or negative) on them, or you provoked their insecurities. So why bother? Focus on yourself (and that doesn't mean you should be an uncompassionate person). Realize *the human nature* so that you don't dwell on the negative impacts from others.
- Never compare yourself to others. You're just dosing yourself some copium by doing so. The situation isn't changed. No output. Stay in your lane and keep up progress. There are no limits except for the ones you place on yourself. Shut the fuck up and Execute.
- The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won.
- It is so important to remember when judging success — both your own and others’: “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”
- The pain of not achieving your goals must outweigh the pain of living a mediocre life.
- The path out of a low point is trial and error, the essence of life itself.
- To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.
- You can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.
- Self-confidence comes from doing what you think is uncomfortable, over and over again, and realizing it wasn't that bad in the first place.
- You aren’t confident because you are trapped in someone else’s story. You don’t have a chance to transform into who you were meant to become.
- There are no limits except for the ones you place on yourself. Practically speaking, you're the only one who can stop yourself and also the only one moving forward. Never compare yourself to someone who seems to effortlessly achieved your goals and then underestimate your abilities. If there's proof that something is humanly possible, you can (partially) make it happen.  
- You get somewhere by building genuine relationships:
	- Giving with no intention of receiving in return
	- Acting in the service of others
	- Creating value for those around you
