# Assets
- Your most precious asset: time. Use it wisely.
- If you buy something and resort to mental gymnastics over affordability, YOU CAN’T AFFORD IT. Any kind of self-talk is a warning that you can’t afford it. True affordability doesn’t have strings attached. You can bluff yourself but you can’t bluff the consequences.
- Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to give you control over your time.
- You don’t need tremendous force to create tremendous results.
- Reshape life’s focus on producing, not consuming. Instead of digging for gold, sell shovels. Instead of taking a class, offer a class. Instead of borrowing money, lend it.
- To consume richly, produce richly first.
- Asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought.
- Debt is **only** useful if it allows me to *build and grow* my system. Other than than, there's no reason to get in debt.
- Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.

# Wealth
- “Get Rich Quick” must not be confused with “Get Rich Easy”.
- Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.
- You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. You get rich by saving your time to make money.
- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
- Money follows mindful execution, not precedes it.
- Diversification is for wealth preservation and protection, not wealth creation.
- Wealth is authored by strong familial relationships, fitness and health, and ***freedom***—not by material possessions. What steals freedom, steals wealth.
- Wealth doesn’t drop from the sky or come from a game show. Wealth from lottery/gambling? Taking that route, you essentially become a hitchhiker with no seat belt. 
- The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn.
- The leading cause of poorness is *poor* ***choices***. Blame/credit yourself and the choices you’ve made. Choices of *perception* precede choices of action. If you believe and perceive a certain idea, you are likely to act on that belief. If your car’s fuel tank had a small leak, how would you fix it?
	- The symptomatic solver would increase his trips to the gas station to ensure a steady inflow of fuel. The problematic solver plugs up the hole.
- People don’t choose to be poor. They make poor decisions that slowly assemble into a poorness puzzle. Retrace the footprints to poverty and it happens slowly, systematically, and methodically, under a steady diet of poor choices.
- Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life. Wealth is built with time as an asset, not as a liability.
- The ultimate wealth is having the free time to live how you want to live.
- The primary wealth accelerant of the rich boils down to one concept: Appreciable and controllable assets.
- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.
- Exponential growth of income and asset value, not slashing expenses, creates millionaires.
- Wealth is accelerated by exploding income and Asset value via a business that can be systemized and eventually sold in a liquidation event.
- Wealth is made up of coordinated commitment to ***action***: a conscious choice, and then a commitment to that choice in the form of relentless action.
- The more lives you affect in an entity you control, in scale and/or magnitude, the richer you will become. Impact millions and make millions. The closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to wealth. To serve millions is to make millions.

# Factors
## Perception
- The happiest people in the world have a tight sense of community, social support, and strong family bonds.
- Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.
- Pursuing an intrinsic hierarchy of goals is a big key to happiness. It is how you reap the benefits of the good dopamine that comes from survival mechanisms in your brain.
> It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. 
> It’s much better to be at 9/10 or 10/10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into many things. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It’s usually things you’re obsessed about.
- More money is not a solution to poor financial management.
- Live below your means but seek to expand your means by focusing on income while simultaneously controlling expenses
- Money doesn't buy happiness? Partially true. More precisely, *money buys free time* and eliminates indentured time.
- Spending money to show people how much money you have (or to impress other people) is the *fastest* way to have less money.
- Everything has a price, but not all prices appear on labels. 
>The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.
- “**Enough**” is realizing that the insatiable appetite for more will push you to the point of regret. 
- Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. Because things that have never happened before happen all the time. Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.
- Combining short-term caution with long-term optimism is essential for navigating the uncertainties of life and the economy.
- Saving is the gap between your ego and your income.
> Events are residual by-products of process. A goal is the event, the execution is the process. Ideas are worthless, execution is priceless. Focus on the process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and ultimately, events.
- The smallest choices made in your daily life create habits and lifestyle that forms process—they are the ones that can make the biggest impact.
- Value your time poorly and you will be poor. When time is wasted as a lifestyle choice you will be stranded in places you don’t want to be.
- Judgment—especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability and a clear track record—is critical.
- The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.
- Take advice from people with a proven, successful track record of their espoused discipline. Many gurus teach one wealth equation while getting rich in another. They’re not rich from their own teachings. Beware of them.
## Possibilities
- Luck is created by increased probabilities that are improved with the process of action. It is the residue of engagement. Process creates events that others see as luck.
- Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.
- Risk is escalated when you get into business doing what you love versus doing what needs to be done.
- Risk is escalated when you cede control over major business functions to someone who you blindly trusted.
- You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from.
- Despite what you may have read or heard, wealth is a process, not an event (*and so does luck*). Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. ***Without process, there is no event***.
- Ways to get lucky: 
	• Hope luck finds you. 
	• Hustle until you stumble into it. 
	• Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss. 
	• Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny. 
- Opportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately. Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification for better service. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of business.
- Do not mistake a confident explanation for an accurate prediction.
- You may not be able to control what luck you encounter, but you can certainly prepare to take advantage of it. Only the skilled are ready for their luck
## Execution
- Spreading out your bets and staying the course through the ups and downs can lead to outsized successes, thanks to the power of tail events.
- Answer three questions about every decision of *consequence*:
	- What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?
	- What is the probability of this outcome?
	- Is this an acceptable risk?
- Play the long term game. Compound interest always win.
- Thinking - alone by itself - never made anyone free(or rich), unless that thinking manifests itself into consistent action toward application of laws that worked.
- The *owner* of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who *executes* it.
- Execution is taking the neurological fart that is an idea and making it smell like a rose.
- The best business plan in the world will always be a ***track record of execution***. Create a track record that others can see or touch. Dive into process. Be good enough and they will be fighting to give you money.
> The market tells you which direction you should be going at all times. Be humble and heed the signs. Complaints are the world’s whispers hinting the direction you should be moving.
