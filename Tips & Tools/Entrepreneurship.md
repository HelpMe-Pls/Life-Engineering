- Self-improvement is about solving problems in your life. Entrepreneurship is about solving problems in others life. When you do both, you unlock purpose, meaning, and fulfillment.
- You weren't born with an interest. You were programmed into it. You were persuaded of its importance and adopted it to help you achieve your goals in life. So find a way to articulate that into story, make it intriguing enough so that you grasp the attention for your audience.
- Building an audience of people is to remove your dependency on your employer, government, and any other centralized entity that controls most aspects of your life.
- In brief, launch products around the ideas that do well for you. Every 3-6 months, launch at least one free product and one paid product until you have a brand and business you are satisfied with.
- You are to become the _source_ for your interests to attract an audience to them. Not an influencer, a producer. ***A value creator***, to be exact. You are trying to improve the lives of others by consuming, synthesizing, developing, creating, and selling value.
- Value creators are those who dedicate themselves to their interests, take it on as their life’s work to explore them, and distill the information into education.
- Get in the habit of starting projects that you have no idea how to complete and figure out how to complete it.
- Embrace the struggle. That's where the most impactful lessons come from.

# Starting a business
## Build awareness

> [!important] Customer centricity
> - None of this will work if you create what you _think_ will help others VS what is *actually* going to help others. 
> - They only care about what those skills, interests, and advices can do ***for them***.
> - Specifically, what it can do to **improve *their* direct human experience and quality of life.**
> - Improvement stems from **awareness**. People cannot improve what they are not aware of. You must educate them to the point of making them aware.
> - You take people from _unaware to aware_ and beginner level _to **your level**_.
> - Your job is to spread seeds of awareness and funnel people into tools that will ***help them improve*** that area of their life.

- The levels of Awareness
	1. **Unaware:** unaware of the problem
	2. **Problem Aware:** aware that they have a problem but not sure what is causing it or how to solve it
	3. **Solution Aware:** aware that a solution exists, but are unaware of your solution (free or paid resources)
	4. **Product Aware:** aware of your free or paid solution, but either haven't implemented it or are hesitant on purchasing
	5. **Most Aware:** aware of your solution and are ready to act on it — all they need is a little push (with persuasion and influence)
- Your top-of-funnel content (social media platforms) should target all of the above, with levels 1-3 as the priority.
- Your bottom-of-funnel content (emails, lead magnets, and products) should also target all of the above, with levels 3-5 as the priority.
### Problems and solutions
- If you've solved a problem in your life, you're qualified to start a business. Not just any business, an education business with minimal startup costs.
- A business means you're selling something. Start with selling the solutions to the problems in your life. Every problem has a different method of being solved that is unique to you (how you solve it).
- First, understand why people buy a product. ***They want to see a transformation***. People want *clear* education from someone who is 1 to 2 steps ahead of them. So, we start with the eternal markets:
	- Health, wealth, relationships, and fulfilment. If you have experience in any of those domains, you're good to go. 
- Once you have a digital product, the amount of money you make is determined by how much traffic you send to the product.

> You will never ever feel like you know **exactly** what you are doing. That's the nature of the process. Get used to it. Let go of the need to be perfect. Have faith in the process.

- When you find yourself narrowly focused, stressed, and anxious about your progress — zoom out.
- The effectiveness of your brand, content, and offers are a combination of 3 things: 
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Skills |skills]]: determines the quality of the ***perceived value*** you deliver
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Expertise |expertise]]: give you a unique ***perspective*** on certain topics
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Curiosities |curiosities]]: allows you to monetize the ***attention*** you are grabbing

>[!important] The Law of Effection
> **NET PROFIT** = *Units Sold (**Scale** | Breadth) **×** Unit Profit (**Magnitude** | Depth)*
> - The internet provides unprecedented access to scale. 
> - Your job is to take advantage of that while increasing the value of your products. High value -> high price -> high magnitude. 
> - Billionaires make giant impacts millions of times.
## Content creation
- ***EVERY*** piece of your content and interaction with your audience ***must*** aim to the final target of addressing a specific **pain** and/or **benefit** that lies in people's life. This is the foundation of persuasion and sparking behavior change.
- Behavior change is how you get other's to improve their lives. In turn, they will attribute their success to you. A transaction of any kind must be beneficial to _all_ parties involved. A win-win.
- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
- **Just start *sincerely* helping people.** Get to know them. Ask them what they are working on. See if your skills can help with that. Offer to help them *for free* and give them tips.
	- At minimum, you have a connection that respects you. At maximum, you get results and potential work from them *or **referrals***.
- Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.
- When in doubt — go beginner level. Here is a general, foolproof process for making a solid income:
	- Post beginner and intermediate level content from *your unique perspective* (based on research and experience)
	- Educate people and **go more in-depth** with longer-form emails, articles, and a lead magnet to raise them up [[maslows.png |Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] (this is where you can show how smart you are and build a deeper connection without having to worry about the algorithm).
- Sell a beginner level product to filter out buyers from free-loaders
- Again, you are educating them to the point of being a fit for your other *paid* products or services (creating your own customers in a sense).
- Then, upsell other products, membership, or freelance / consulting service to those that purchased your product.
> It is You — but at scale.
### Skills
- Here are the skills that will boost the impact and income from your online endeavors:
	- Copywriting (persuasive writing)
	- Email marketing (for trust-building and sales)
	- Sales (for closing deals and networking properly)
	- Web design (for landing pages and a personal website)
	- Social media growth (for sending traffic and audience building)
	- Graphic design (for visuals and brand assets)
	- Marketing & advertising (for getting people to act)​​​​​​​
- ***ALL*** of those skills rely on a set of meta-skills:
	- Grabbing and holding attention
	- Storytelling & persuasion
	- Psychology & human behavior
	- Self-awareness and observation
	- Philosophy and spirituality
#### Persuasion
- The greatest skill of all is *persuasion*. You are creating an argument to adopt *your* perspective and ***see the benefit*** in viewing things in the way that you do. 
- Your persuasion should cause that raise in dopamine that sparks the "aha!" moment. The breakthrough. The "this may finally be the solution to my problem."
- Then, you deliver as much value as you possibly can to fulfill that promise.
> Giving **clear and actionable** steps to achieving a desired outcome is at the core of any successful persuasion.

>[!info]- Train your mind
>Train your mind to think in terms of problems and benefits that occur ***in any given situation***. This is how you turn topics, life experiences, and random thoughts into compelling content.
##### The values
- A good persuasion should be able to answer these questions:
	- What are **the downsides** of viewing things from a certain perspective and the day-to-day ***pains*** associated with it? By painting a picture of the problem that an individual is facing, you begin to **make them aware** of it enough to seek a solution (*your* solution).
	- What are **the upsides** of viewing things from a new perspective and the day-to-day ***benefits*** associated with it? You can guide people deeper into how the big problem is impacting their experience (raising their awareness even more). Get *specific* with the *benefits* of your product rather than its features.
	- What is **the process** for getting there and can you ***make it simple*** enough to *act on immediately*?
- A successful persuasion should offer:
	- **Positive behavior change**: behavior change is what makes people remember you for changing their life. If you can relate to the problems people are experiencing with personal or client stories, you show them that change is possible
	- **The value conversion**: there has to be an exchange of value here, a transaction (e.g. making the sale, scheduling a date, getting engagement, having your content shared,...). ==An ideal persuasion gives people the one thing they crave (and often lack) — _clarity_==.
	- **Mutual benefit**: we want to aim to deliver _more_ value than what we receive.
##### The ingredients
- A persuasive argument is made up of 6 traits:
	- **Reciprocity**: give out value and good things will come to you. When you do them the favor of dropping the price (intelligently) they feel compelled to meet that favor.
	- **Commitment/Consistency**: this can be used by easing people into things and getting them to take the lowest friction action first (e.g. liking a post, clicking a link, filling out a form,...)
	- **Social Proof**: the human nature is constantly looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions. Therefore: testimonials, results, and word of mouth marketing is the most powerful persuasion tool in your arsenal. The more *authentic and non-planned*, the better.
	- **Liking**: we tend to like people that like us. If you can compliment someone on their work, be interested in _them,_ and offer the value you can (even if its just a resource you came across relating to what they are working on), they will like you. This is just another level of reciprocity.
	- **Authority**: we tend to trust authoritative figures much quicker, and that's determined by: level of expertise, social proof, accomplishments in a specific area, well known labels or symbols,...
	- **Scarcity**: this is on the emotion side of things. It's the FOMO. Make a deadline for the discount. The last day is always the day you make more sales.
### Expertise
- You are leveraging your ability to solve your own problems, document the process via content, and create a product that you can *sell to your former self*.
- If you can teach former you (that was a beginner) how to get to where you are now in a streamlined way, you win.
- And that process requires ***ALL*** of these skills:
	- Personal growth
	- Social media growth
	- Authority building
	- Market research
	- Marketing
	- Offer creation
- If you attract people with similar interests as you, educate them, and give them a process that shaves 2-3 years off of their learning time — they will pay you.
- You can create a product on anything you feel like ***if*** you can position it correctly within those markets.
- The best products solve a problem that impacts a specific person's *direct* experience in a positive way. 
### Curiosities
- Here is a general way to incorporate your curiosities into your brand:
	- Write out 2-3 of your interests (the things you LOVE talking about)
	- Write out 2-3 options for eventual monetization (skills or interests like health or performance coaching)
	- Think big and small — write out broader interests and skills, then write out niche interests and skill relating to the 2-3 points you wrote out already. This starts to create a web of content ideas and curiosities to pursue
	- Keep an eye out for books, content, podcasts, and life experiences that check one of those boxes
	- Make a note of it and create some form of content around it. Opening a curiosity loop (by asking a question or implying a puzzle with a missing piece)
- The skill of storytelling is vital for grabbing [[Entrepreneurship#The network |attention]].

## Build your system
- For your products to generate sustainable income, you need 2 things: 
	- An offer: is the specific **desired** outcome that you are **promising** they will get when they purchase and use it. You are selling a desired _benefit_ that helps resolve their _pain._
	- ***Interested*** traffic: you have to be intentional about ***where*** you are placing the offer, how it is perceived to that person, and place a heavy focus on how it impacts their life.
- Forget the money for a bit. Develop your value and practice offering it to others *without expectation* of anything in return.
### The network
- The first step towards any transaction of value is capturing attention. This is where the attention to your products come from:
	- The audience: start by dominating one platform — then use your validated content, social proof, and network to grow rapidly on other platforms (and funnel your audience there). ==Give *free content* in exchange for engagement and shares. Give free products in exchange for their email==.
	- The email list: great for people who are in the working class, one of the best funnel to your paid products.
	- The community: deeper, more valuable content in exchange for a click on your paid products. Buyers buy again. Think of a platform like Zalo, Facebook, Discord, Telegram, or somewhere else to *build authority **away** from the algorithm.*
	- As these grows, you gain leverage. You can begin to free up time and focus on bigger levers.
- When you don't have an audience or other distribution built, you have to rely on outreach, referrals, and connections. ==**The goal is to get used to meeting new people**==. Form the habit of DMing and meeting people (e.g. when you see a post that crosses your timeline that you really like, message the person telling them what resonated with you and start a conversation) that you can offer your value to, by:
	- Making your offer hyper specific to your client
	- People like being praised for their work — especially the work that not many people noticed. Focus on that. If they mention something you can help with, offer help.
	- Start with a service business, making some money, getting results, and packaging up that system into a product.

# Scaling your business

>[!info] Productize yourself
>- “Yourself ” has uniqueness and accountability. “Productize” has leverage and specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific knowledge in there.
>- If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital (permissioned leverage) or with code or with media (permissionless leverage)?”
>- If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that.
