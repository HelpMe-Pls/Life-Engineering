- Self-improvement is about solving problems in your life. Entrepreneurship is about solving problems in others life. When you do both, you unlock purpose, meaning, and fulfillment.
- You weren't born with an interest. You programmed yourself into it. You were persuaded of its importance and adopted it to help you achieve your goals in life. So find a way to articulate that into story, make it intriguing enough so that you grasp the attention for your audience.
- [[Writing#Build an audience |Building an audience]] of people is to remove your dependency on your employer, government, and any other centralized entity that controls most aspects of your life.
- In brief, launch products around the ideas that did well for you. Every 3-6 months, launch at least one free product and one paid product until you have a brand and business you are satisfied with.
> If someone can “flip a switch” and destroy your business, you’re playing roulette with your financial plan. Take **extreme ownership** (that doesn't mean you must disregard delegation).
> If you can outsource something or not do something for less than your ideal hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That's how you spend your money to buy back your time.
- You are to become the _source_ of your interests to attract an audience. Not an influencer, a producer. ***A value creator***, to be exact. You are trying to improve the lives of others by consuming, synthesizing, developing, creating, and distributing value. The heart of entrepreneurship is creation and innovation.
- Value creators are those who dedicate themselves to their interests, take it on as their life’s work to explore them, and distill the information into education. 
- ==Putting a new spin on something old is also a viable path for creators==. Take what already exists, then make them better. Train yourself to spot hidden gems, take them and apply better marketing to make it your product.
> [!important]- THINK like a producer
> To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others. Stop chasing money and start chasing **needs**, or factors that drive the needs (problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions).
> 
> Fun fact: The **need** is actually the **most important** aspect of all in the world of business. That's exactly why e-thots are millionaires, because they address a primal need - sexual need.  
- You must understand the big picture strategy with all of its moving parts before you start trying to make the system work. 
- It is easy to get overwhelmed if you try to do everything at once. Start small, then work up.
- Get in the habit of starting projects that you have a vague idea how to complete it and figure out along the way.
- Anyone can get any result they want in life with enough trial and error. Courses just help people skip a few of those trials and errors.
- Embrace the struggle. That's where the most impactful lessons come from.

# Starting a business
TL;DR: For online business, the principles are:
- Build a brand first, then a business. Brands don’t have identity crises, businesses do.
- Create a product or service (physical or digital)
- Learn marketing and sales to communicate its value
- Send traffic to your product or service (social media, ads, referrals,...)
- The **DON'Ts**:
	- Invest in a needless business
	- Trade time for money
	- Operate on a limited scale
	- Relinquish control
	- Let your business startup be an event over process
## Build awareness

> [!important] Customer centricity
> - None of this will work if you create what you _think_ will help others VS what is *actually* going to help others. 
> - They only care about what those skills, interests, and advices can do ***for them***.
> - Specifically, what it can do to **improve *their* direct human experience and quality of life.**
> - Improvement stems from **awareness**. People cannot improve what they are not aware of. You must educate them to the point of making them aware.
> - You take people from _unaware to aware_ and beginner level _to **your level**_.
> - Your job is to spread seeds of awareness and funnel people into tools that will ***help them improve*** that area of their life.

- The levels of Awareness
	1. **Unaware:** they don't know what they don't know
	2. **Problem Aware:** aware that they have a problem but not sure what is causing it or how to solve it
	3. **Solution Aware:** aware that a solution exists, but are unaware of your solution (free or paid resources)
	4. **Product Aware:** aware of your free or paid solution, but either haven't implemented it or are hesitant on purchasing
	5. **Most Aware:** aware of your solution and are ready to act on it — all they need is a little push (with persuasion and influence)
- Your top-of-funnel content (social media platforms) should target all of the above, with levels 1-3 as the priority.
- Your bottom-of-funnel content (emails, lead magnets, and products) should also target all of the above, with levels 3-5 as the priority.
### Problems and solutions
- If you've solved a problem in your life, you're qualified to start a business. Not just any business, an education business with minimal startup costs.
- A business means you're selling something. Start with selling the solutions to the problems in your life. Every problem has a different method of being solved that is **_[[Entrepreneurship#The niche |unique to you]]_** (how you solve it).
- You will never become an expert if the only person you help is yourself. You have to help other people with different situations and perspectives to refine your craft.
- The digital economy rewards [[#Authenticity]]. No one can compete with you if you can operate at the intersection of your unique skillset, interests, and personality.
- First, understand why people buy a product. ***They want to see a transformation***.
> People only care about what your business can do **for them**. How can your products make their life easier, more meaningful? What **value** are you adding to **their life**?
- People want ***clear*** *education* from someone who is 1 to 2 steps ahead of them. So, we start with the ==eternal markets==:
	- Health, wealth, relationships, and fulfilment. 
	- Those markets can be broken down into sub-markets like fitness, online business, dating, and spirituality.
	- If you have experience in any of those domains, you're good to go. 
- Once you have a digital product, the amount of money you make is determined by how much traffic you send to the product.
	- Note that traffic to your products is not the same as *competitors traffic*. Low-barrier-entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high competition and higher traffic, which creates lower margins for the participants. Saturation causes declining sales volumes. Declining sales volumes cause profit erosion.
	- Exceptionalism is required to overcome weak entry barriers.
	- ==The entry to your business must be a **strenuous process**, ***not an event***.==

> You will never ever feel like you know **exactly** what you are doing. That's the nature of the process. Get used to it. 
> Let go of the need to be perfect. Perfectionism is (most of the time) procrastination masquerading as quality control. Procrastination is the assassination of all destinations. Prioritize execution. Have faith in the process. Be patient.  

- When you find yourself narrowly focused, stressed, and anxious about your progress — zoom out.
- The effectiveness of your brand, content, and offers are a combination of 3 things: 
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Skills |skills]]: determines the quality of the ***perceived value*** you deliver
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Expertise |expertise]]: give you a unique ***perspective*** on certain topics
	- Your [[Entrepreneurship#Curiosities |curiosities]]: allows you to monetize the ***attention*** you are grabbing

>[!important] The Law of Effection
> **NET PROFIT** = *Units Sold (**Scale** | Breadth) **×** Unit Profit (**Magnitude** | Depth)*
> - The internet provides unprecedented access to scale. 
> - Your job is to take advantage of that while increasing the value of your products. High value → high price → high magnitude. 
> - Billionaires make giant impacts millions of times.
> - The marketplaces and consumers - not you - determine if your business is viable.

## Content creation
- ***EVERY*** piece of your content and interaction with your audience ***must*** aim to the final target of addressing a specific **pain** and/or **benefit** that lies in people's life. This is the foundation of persuasion and sparking behavior change.
- Behavior change is how you get other's to improve their lives. In turn, they will attribute their success to you. ==A transaction of any kind must be beneficial to _all_ parties involved. A win-win.==
- A foundation of self-development creates the opportunity for unlimited unique content ideas.
- Self-development implies that you are *actively* improving your mind, body, spirit, finances, and life itself.
- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Once you understand how to develop yourself, you understand how to develop others. Personal growth = business growth.
- **Just start *sincerely* helping people.** Get to know them. Ask them what they are working on. See if your skills can help with that. Offer to help them *for free* and give them tips.
	- At minimum, you have a connection that respects you. At maximum, you get results and potential work from them _or **referrals**_.
- Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.
- When in doubt — go beginner level. Here is a general, foolproof process for making a solid income:
	- Post beginner and intermediate level content from *your unique perspective* (based on research and experience)
	- Educate people and **go more in-depth** with longer-form emails, articles, and a ==lead magnet (i.e. free products - people who download it are added to your email list)== to raise them up [[maslows.png |Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] (this is where you can show how smart you are and build a deeper connection without having to worry about the algorithm).
- Sell a beginner level product to filter out buyers from free-loaders.
- Again, you are educating them to the point of being a fit for your other *paid* products or services (creating your own customers in a sense).
- Then, upsell other products, *membership*, ***subscriptions***, or freelance/consulting service to those that purchased your product.
### Skills
- Here are the skills that will boost the impact and income from your online endeavors:
	- Copywriting (persuasive writing)
	- Email marketing (for trust-building and sales)
	- Sales (for closing deals and networking properly)
	- Web design (for landing pages and a personal website)
	- Social media growth (for sending traffic and audience building)
	- Graphic design (for visuals and brand assets)
	- Marketing & advertising (for getting people to act)​​​​​​​
- ***ALL*** of those skills rely on a set of meta-skills:
	- Grabbing and holding attention
	- Storytelling & persuasion
	- Psychology & human behavior
	- Self-awareness and observation
	- Philosophy and spirituality
#### Persuasion
- The greatest skill of all is *persuasion*. You are creating an argument to adopt *your* perspective and ***[[Writing |see the benefit]]*** in viewing things in the way that you do. 
- All persuasive writing starts with painting a picture of the problem.
- The first human behavior you can count on is *selfishness*. It's primal human nature. People want what they want. Capitalize that.
- Your persuasion should cause that raise in dopamine that sparks the "aha!" moment. The breakthrough. The =="this may ***finally*** be the solution to ***my*** problem"==.
- Then, you deliver as much value as you possibly can to fulfill that promise.
> Giving **clear and actionable** steps to achieving a desired outcome is at the core of any successful persuasion.

>[!info]- Train your mind
>Train your mind to think in terms of _problems and benefits_ that occur ***in any given situation***, practice being **observant** of the ideas and thoughts that pop into your head. This is how you turn topics, life experiences, and random thoughts into compelling content.
##### The values
- A good persuasion should be able to answer these questions:
	- What are **the downsides** of viewing things from a certain perspective and the day-to-day ***pains*** associated with it? By painting a picture of the problem that an individual is facing, you begin to **make them aware** (without pitching your product yet, just make them aware) of it enough to seek a solution (*your* solution).
	- What are **the upsides** of viewing things from a new perspective and the day-to-day ***benefits*** associated with it? You can guide people deeper into how the big problem is impacting their experience (raising their awareness even more). Get *specific* with the *benefits* of your product rather than its features. ==Extrapolate forward the benefit of a certain feature==. This is where you get ahead of your competitors:
		- You don’t buy a Honda; you buy *reliability*.
		- You don’t buy a vacation; you buy an *experience*.
	- What is **the process** for getting there and can you ***make it simple*** enough to *act on immediately*?
- A successful persuasion should offer:
	- **Positive behavior change**: behavior change is what makes people remember you for changing their life. If you can relate to the problems people are experiencing with personal or client stories, you show them that change is possible
	- **The value conversion**: there has to be an exchange of value here, a transaction (e.g. making the sale, scheduling a date, getting engagement, having your content shared,...). ==An ideal persuasion gives people the one thing they crave (and often lack) — **_clarity**_==.
	- **Mutual benefit**: we want to aim to deliver _more_ value than what we receive.
##### The ingredients
- A persuasive argument is [[Entrepreneurship#Networking |made up of]] 6 traits:
	- **[[Entrepreneurship#Follow up |Reciprocity]]**: give out value and good things will come to you. When you do them the favor of (tactically) discount on your product they feel compelled to meet that favor.
	- **Commitment/Consistency**: this can be used by easing people into things and getting them to take the *lowest friction* action first (e.g. liking a post, clicking a link, filling out a form,...)
	- **[[Entrepreneurship#Bonus |Social Proof]]**: the human nature is constantly looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions. Therefore: credentials, testimonials, results, and word of mouth marketing is the most powerful persuasion tool in your arsenal. The more *authentic and non-planned*, the better.
	- **[[Entrepreneurship#Compliment |Liking]]**: we tend to like people that like us. If you can compliment someone on their work, be interested in _them,_ and offer the value you can (even if its just a resource you came across relating to what they are working on), they will like you. This is just another level of reciprocity.
	- **[[Entrepreneurship#Authority |Authority]]**: we tend to trust authoritative figures much quicker, and that's determined by: level of expertise, social proof, accomplishments in a specific area, well known labels or symbols,...
	- **[[#Pricing |Scarcity]]**: this is on the emotion side of things. It's the FOMO. Make a deadline for the discount. The last day is always the day you make more sales.
### Expertise
- You are leveraging your ability to solve your own problems, document the process via content, and create a product that you can *sell to your former self*.
- If you can teach former you (that was a beginner) how to get to where you are now in a streamlined way, you win.
- And that process requires ***ALL*** of these skills:
	- Personal growth
	- Social media growth
	- Authority building
	- Market research
	- Marketing
	- Offer creation
- If you attract people with similar interests as you, educate them, and give them a process that shaves 2-3 years off of their learning time — they will pay you.
- You can create a product on anything you feel like ***if*** you can position it correctly within those markets.
- The best products solve a problem that impacts a specific person's *direct* experience in a positive way. 
### Curiosities
- Here is a general way to incorporate your curiosities into your brand:
	- Write out 2-3 of your interests (the things you LOVE talking about)
	- Write out 2-3 options for eventual monetization (skills or interests like health or performance coaching)
	- Think big and small — write out broader interests and skills, then write out niche interests and skill relating to the 2-3 points you wrote out already. This starts to create a web of content ideas and curiosities to pursue
	- Keep an eye out for books, content, podcasts, and life experiences that check one of those boxes
	- Make a note of it and create some form of content around it. Opening a curiosity loop (by asking a question or implying a puzzle with a missing piece)
- The skill of storytelling is vital for grabbing [[Entrepreneurship#The network |attention]].

## Build your system
- For your products to generate sustainable income, you need 2 things: 
	- An offer: is the specific **desired** outcome that you are **promising** they will get when they purchase and use it. You are selling a desired _benefit_ that helps resolve their _pain._
	- ***Interested*** traffic: you have to be intentional about ***where*** you are placing the offer, how it is perceived to that person, and place a heavy focus on how it impacts their life.
- ==Forget the money for a bit. Develop your value and practice offering it to others *without expectation* of anything in return.==
### The niche
> It is You — but at scale. Curate your product with the same care and attention as if ***you*** were the intended customer.
- ==It is so important to identify the ***need*** in the market==. You can't just simply open a business to "do what you love" or "doing what you're good at". Your expertise must converge with the demands in the market. Your products exist to solve those needs.
- ==_**Be their savior**_==.
	- When hundreds of people get into a business solely because they know how or want to (not need based), you get put into commoditization position: price wars haggling over a few dollars.
	- Or, if you're *so good* at [[#Persuasion |persuading]], try to come up with ideas that create needs.
- Again, focus on the **[[Entrepreneurship#Problems and solutions |eternal markets]]**. People *always* want to make more money, be more productive, look better, be more healthy, have more sex, cultivate more connection, and manage their emotions better.
- Pick one (or some) of those domains, the ones that you're good at (or you possess a relatable skill which leads to that), and show them how to get there, ***your*** way. 
- You are attempting to help someone achieve a transformation _you've made in **your** life_. You are targeting and attracting people who want that *same transformation*. That's your niche.
- The transformation doesn't have to be dramatic. If you make it too dramatic then it'll be hard for your customer to *relate*. It can be quite simple as long as it's desirable.
- You _**must** have_ (prove) a transformation that you can help people achieve. You have topics that you can educate people in based on your own experience and practice.
- You want to relate these milestones throughout your [[Writing#Market research |market research]] posts (or all at once on your sales page):
#### Where was your starting point?
- Dig deep and think about what your life used to look like related to your topic, skill, or interest you plan to monetize.
- Start with a list of things that bother you in your past. Your insecurities. What were the things that you should've done but didn't do. What were the emotions in those phases?
#### What made you want to change?
- We need to amplify their problems and make them understand how it is truly impacting their present and future: 
	- What was your mindset then?
	- Where would your life end up if you kept that mindset?
	- What made you interested in your main topic or interest?
	- What problem of yours were you trying to solve?
	- What parts did you struggle with?
	- What were your biggest "aha" moments?
	- What were your objections before you decided to start?
	- What do you wish you had done differently?
#### What does your ideal day look like?
- Only you know. This will help shape the _transformation_ you are marketing for your products.
- Again, people don't buy products just to buy them, they buy them because they want to ***see** a change* in their life. Clarity enhances persuasion.
#### What goals have you achieved that others desire?
- No matter how "trivial" or underwhelming they seem to you now, what goals have you achieved?
- What are the ***unique** results* you've gotten in your life through your creative, personal, and professional endeavors? How have they been improving your life?
#### How does your product topic/idea solve Their problem?
- Think of:
	- Where you started.
	- Where you are now and where you're going.
	- The skills, knowledge, habits, and education required to get from 0 to 1.
	- **Why that matters**.
- How does the topic of your product help bridge the gap between those?
- ==Your goal is to help people reach one desirable goal by giving them the education and habits in an _**easy-to-implement**_ way. The easier it looks, the better it sells. ==
#### Why should they care about your product?
- People only care about *how* it benefits their lives.
- Write out the benefits of the product's topic/idea so you're able to amplify your marketing. Get as specific as you can with all of these points.
- You are looking for the select pieces of what you don't want, what you want, what you've done, and how your product fits into that as a marketing starting point.

### The network
- The first step towards any transaction of value is capturing attention. This is where the attention to your products come from:
	- **The audience**: start by dominating one platform — then use your validated content, social proof, and network to grow rapidly on other platforms (and funnel your audience there). ==Give *free content* in exchange for engagement and shares. Give free products in exchange for their email==.
	- **The email list**: great for people who are in the working class, one of the best funnel to your paid products.
	- **The community**: deeper, more valuable content in exchange for a click on your paid products. Buyers buy again. Think of a platform like Discord, Telegram, or somewhere else to *build authority **away** from the algorithm.*
		- As these grows, you gain leverage. You can begin to free up time and focus on bigger levers.
- When you don't have an audience or other distribution built, you have to rely on outreach, referrals, and connections. ==**The goal is to get used to meeting new people**==. Form the habit of DMing and meeting people (e.g. when you see a post that crosses your timeline that you really like, message the person telling them what resonated with you and start a conversation) that you can offer your value to, by:
	- Making your offer hyper specific to your client
	- People like being praised for their work — especially the work that not many people noticed. Focus on that. If they mention something you can help with, offer help.
	- Start with a service business, making some money, getting results, and packaging up that system into a product.

# Scaling your business

>[!info] Productize yourself
>- “Yourself” has uniqueness and accountability. “Productize” has leverage and specific knowledge. “Yourself” also has specific knowledge in there.
>- If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital (passive-permissioned leverage) or with code or with media (active-permissionless leverage)?”
>- If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that.
- Remember: cognitive, mental, physical or intellectual development is necessary if you want your work to evolve over time. As your business scales, so does your mind & body.
- Selfish, narcissistic motives do not make good, long-term business models.
## Social leverage
- A mixture of growth and authority is a great place to focus for beginners. The combination of all 3 is essential for the sustainability of your business.
### Growth
- The main thing that will determine growth is your content and top-of-funnel socials media:
	- Is your content being shared?
	- Will your content make people **click on your profile** and wonder "Who is this guy?"
	- Is your content polarizing due to speaking with confidence on the subject at hand?
- Study what kind of content is doing well, incorporate that into some of your future releases, and be sure it is getting shared by your connections.
#### Tactics
- DJs and producers grow by remixing popular songs so they can “steal” the traffic from that popular song.
- Similar to how YouTubers make reaction videos to leverage the traffic that the larger creator is getting.
- Bigger accounts have bigger audiences. But make sure that the audience are not bots. ==Make sure the audience *has engagement*==. You'll want some of that. Work your way in. Use their [[#Authority]] as your leverage.
- These are in no specific order. Test them all and see what works best:
##### Replies
- If you reply to viral posts, and readers go into the comments, they have a chance of seeing your reply.
- If your reply is ***good***, they may click on your profile, read your content, and *follow you*.
	- Tell people what you’ve experienced in your life relating to whatever the creator said in the content you are replying to. Use aspects of your life’s story to add value to the post. Talking about yourself leads to the most profile clicks.
- Start with replying to small accounts. That's how you refine your words. Small accounts are for building your tribe, not gaining new followers. Large accounts are for making your name known in the space and gaining followers. 
##### Quotes and tags
- Use this when you have something to say and want it to be in front of your audience rather than in the replies.
- If you quote post or tag someone with valuable advice or something interesting (something that makes its reader _**feel good to share**_), the original creator may repost you to their audience. This means you get more eyes on your content, which increases the potential for people to click on your profile and follow you.
- If you are going to quote a post, choose one from large accounts or one that's gone viral and take a lot of time to think out your argument or post around a topic that you know will do well.
##### Reposts
- Always think this through before hitting post:
	- Will people share it? Why should they share it? Do they identify with anything I am saying? Is it polarizing enough to spark discussion and get comments?
- Notice how *you* repost other posts. The common traits are:
	- It ***feels*** good to repost (something you strongly agree with, and/or something that makes you better perceived in the eyes of others).
	- Serves as a secondary "bookmark" to your profile so you can come back later.
##### DMs
- Check [[#Networking |this]] out.

### Authority
- Authority comes down to 2 things: depth and [[Entrepreneurship#The ingredients |social proof]].
- Depth comes from long-form content: newsletters and blogs.
> ***Start with a free product*** that gives away valuable advice or actionable insights for a specific skill or interest. From there, you can lead them into a paid product *around that same topic*.
> Free products should help your audience achieve **one small desirable goal** with a mini course or eBook.
- Once you've established authority you can easily pivot (since the content and other free information you've created to build that authority will be up forever - as long as the internet exists).
### Authenticity
- Expressing opinions, likes, and dislikes to relate with those in your audience.
- Documenting projects that you are working on. Show them the process, and what you've learnt from that.
- Differentiation is a defense to commoditization. Be unique & real.
- Be relatable by showing mortality. Be vulnerable (but not in a pitiful way) by acknowledging your shortcomings and what you plan to do differently.

## Networking
- Knowing how to communicate and DM another person that you want to connect with will open up opportunities to paid work, social leverage, and meeting high-level people.
- The final goal is to put your name in more peoples mouths. The more people that know about you, the more work and potential connections will be sent your way. **Get your name in front of as many eyes as possible.**
- Leverage other people's audiences for traffic by getting your content shared to their audience.
- Promote your product on content ***relevant*** to the topic of the product.
- ==Closed mouths don't get fed==. Here are some steps to let more people know about your presence:
### Identify your target
- **Find somebody that you WANT to DM**: these are the people from whom you are inspired by, the ones that you would want to work with, strategize with and most important of all, you see potential for ***mutual benefit***. 
- Start within your circles, and once you have an audience and leverage, you can really reach out to anybody and get a warm response.
- If you want to increase the chances of larger accounts responding to your DMs: follow them and engage with their content for a few days before reaching out so they are familiar with your face and profile picture.
### Compliment
- **Send them an inspired compliment**: find a ==_**specific**_ piece== of their content, work, or current projects that you are *truly* inspired by and tell them *how* it motivate/inspire you, or just simply ask them to further discuss on that topic, spark their engagement, create open loops. 
- People love praise, and per the principle of *reciprocity*, will feel obligated to repay this soft favor.
### Show interest
- **Showing interest makes you interesting**: ask them about: their goals, what drives them, what are they pursuing. 
- Pay attention to their profile, from which you can pick up more hints about their vocation.
### Lead with value
- Please, ==don't go straight for a transaction when you haven't given anything ***first***.==
- If you have to ask more questions in order to send better actionable tips or resources (YouTube videos, articles, or any *helpful* thing) do it. You have to ***truly*** want to help them — *or pique their interest*.
- The least you can do: 
	- Connect them with someone else in your network
	- Just continue having a good conversation and showing interest
	- Offer something that potentially raises their curiosity (or controversial) *in **their** field*, by asking more clarifying questions or seeking ***their*** opinion on something that you may have mutual interest. 
### Make deeper connection
- Making that "face-to-face" interaction is priceless. Nobody can see you, your personality, or your mannerisms via text. This step offers a major raise to your [[Entrepreneurship#Authority |authority]] and [[Entrepreneurship#Authenticity |authenticity]].
- You can also take the conversation to somewhere like Telegram and send voice messages to make yourself seem more human.
- When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. Beware of your emotional outputs.
### Follow up
- Make sure to initiate your follow up with *you offering value* by taking notes about them, remember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people you can send their way.  
- By this point you've built a pretty damn solid connection. You've given value to the point where they are ready to return the favor.
- If your plan is to leverage their audience for growth, be sure to write a post that *they would want* to share. Then, you can send it to them and mention that they inspired that post. Remember to ask for their permission to mention their name/work in your post. For example:
	- "*Ayy, I was inspired by our previous conversation. I'm planning to write a post about it. Could I mention you and your work in it?*"
	- Then, send the finished post to them *after* you posted it. ==***Never*** ask them to share it==. Let them engage with it however they see fit. If your post somehow increase *their* [[Entrepreneurship#Social leverage |social leverage]], it's just a matter of time when they share it for your benefits.
### Build your tribe
- Connect with people who are around your level. Create an insider's group. Help each other [[#Growth |grow]]. 
- You can join existing groups as well. The member limit should be less than 20 for focused effort.

## Marketing
- The more developed the market, the more strategic you have to be. Stay out of false promises, countdown timers, marketing gimmicks, and bold claims.
- People are loyal to brands and relationships, not corporations or businesses. A brand is the best defense to commoditization.
- Derived from the [[Entrepreneurship#Problems and solutions |eternal markets]], whenever you write content, sales pages, or promotions for your product write it from the lens of one of (or a combination of) these desires:
	- Career advancement
	- Skill acquisition
	- Social acceptance
	- Sexual companionship
	- Life enjoyment
	- Status and success
	- Freedom and courage
- Most people just want to know ***exactly*** what they're getting and *how* it impacts their life. All we have to do is be honest and authentic. Build your sales pitch around these outcomes to deliver a clear and believable goal:
	- A desired outcome that is 1-2 steps ahead of where they are, not 10-20 steps.
	- A *timeframe* for when they can achieve that goal.
	- A *quantifiable* metric (with tangible data - numbers).
	- Example: "*The roadmap from $0 to $100K to $1M as one-person*". This pitch satisfied the structure of (timeframe + quantifiable metric & desired outcome). Get creative.
- If you can incorporate interaction or “try before you buy” into your campaigns, or "money back guarantee", you will have better success.
- If you start with the marketing, and make it truly irresistible, then the product can be crafted in order to deliver on that.
> Don't market what you can't deliver.
### Desire
- Marketing is all about _**desired** transformations_. In essence, you are helping people go from where they are now to where they *want* to be.
- People don't care about the features of your product, all they care about is ***how*** it improves their life. They care about the problems it solves and the *process* towards their goals.
> They want low effort, least friction and quick results. Craft your words around those traits.
- Which means, focus on [[Entrepreneurship#The values |the delivery]] of ***benefits*** and *transformations* rather than showing features. For example, pick the latter pitch over the former:
	- Our product provides a scientifically proven habit tracker.
	- Transform anxiety and overwhelm into seamless productivity with our habit replacement system, efficiently accomplish your daily tasks within 4 hours of deep focus.
- Use surveys, polls to get people to interact with your services/products and give you an idea of what they want.
### Bonus
- Some people will buy just because of the bonuses. Bonus should be free. People love free stuff. Make a list of bonuses that you can include with your product to increase its perceived value:
	- A free 30 minute coaching session to help them make better use of your main product.
	- A Slack or Discord community where buyers can interact.
	- Templates or frameworks to help them with guided education and work.
	- Tips & tricks to quantify the values of your main product.
- The most effective way to distribute bonuses is by unlocking them through testimonials. Genuine positive reviews increase your product's [[Writing#Social proof |social proof]]. Your product has to provide tangible values to make this happen.
### Guaranty
- You are attempting to reduce the perceived risk of investing in your product. 
	- Payment options (split payments, financing,...)
	- Money back guarantee (a bit generic)
	- Social proof throughout the page
	- Other proof that shows your offer WORKS
	- Your authority on social media and in the general eye (your content and value you provide outside of the product)
- What makes your company different from the rest? What will [[#Persuasion |compel]] a customer to buy from you over someone else? Specify your action and evidence of that action. Use assertive, reassuring words, best delivered in one-liner fashion:
	- "*If we send you nothing, you pay nothing.*"
	- “Delivered on time” → “_Delivered within 30 minutes or it’s free_.”
- ==You must stick to your words and deliver your claim==, or get exposed and go bankrupt.
> [!important]- Free marketing
> - Determine your customers’ expectation profile. What are their expectations when they deal with your business? How do they relate to competitors and similar businesses in your industry? 
> - Make a subjective call on how your customers expect service. Then **exceed** their expectation. Make it a **feel-good surprise**.
> - Spend more effort on exceedingly serve existing clients rather than on new customer acquisition.

## Pricing
### In
> If you start too high and aren't making as many sales as you want to, it's going to be hard to justify to your current customers why you lowered the price without having to refund them.
- Your price tag should promote an "impulse buy", i.e. it's cheap enough for them to buy without doing mental gymnastics on the decision. Start with a price that you think you'd buy without a second thought. 
- 2000 ***authentic*** followers is a good place to start monetizing.
- Start low and give yourself room to increase the price a few times. Work your way up from $20 → $50 → $69 → $100 → $150 → $225.
- Price implies value and worth. The more expensive your price, the higher its perceived value. Price is apart of the brand build. What makes your product different from the rest? Why should someone pay you more?
	- Consumers make buying decisions based on emotions before practicality.
	- If you can arouse audience emotions, convincing customers to buy is easier.
- Enable early birds prices with 30% off from your desired price. Price increases are a "scarcity event". You will make the most money during your product launch and price increases while sustaining a baseline number of sales in between.
- An [example](https://www.kboges.com/courses).
### Out
- You can pay for legitimate big accounts (those that have a good number of ***organic*** audience members) to repost or reply to your posts, i.e. buying their shares.
- DM them, ask if they offer help to grow, and negotiate a deal, something along the lines of:
	- "_Hey, do you help with growth at all? I’ve been writing content for a bit and want to invest in some help. If so, what do you offer? I’m happy to talk about this somewhere else if you want_."
- Paying for shares is a way to get your content in front of a larger audience without relying on the algorithm that keeps most beginners from ever advancing.
- Paying for shares is not a quick fix to your skill set, it is an *amplifier*. Bad turns worse and good turns better. Choose your [[Writing#Filter out your top performers |top performers]] for paid shares.
- As you notice a flow of followers coming in, funnel them to your [[Writing#Product category |products]] via [[Writing#Medium form |medium]] and [[Writing#Long form |long]] form content.
> Once you grow big enough (100k+ followers), you can sell a repost/share service and turn it into [[#In |an income]]. 
#### Tactics
- Before you start paying for shares:
	- Make sure the account has decent engagement on their posts.
	- Make sure you want the audience that they have.
	- Reach out to personal brands with 20K+ followers.
	- Be willing to pay more for quality (start with $25 for a repost).
	- You can reach out to large anonymous accounts, just be sure that they have some personality and aren’t posting shallow basic content that gets ***loads*** of engagement, i.e. bots.
	- [[Writing#Filter out your top performers |Pick/create]] tweets that resonate with the content realm of your seller. Make it relatable to *their* audience so that you have a chance to funnel their customers into your system. 
- Prefer:
	- Reposts on X
	- Replies on LinkedIn
	- Story shares on Instagram. When you share your post with someone on Instagram, tell them to share it to their story.
## Feedback
- There are four types of complaints:
	- **Complaints of Change**: change/update endangers comfort, expectancy, and security. Expect this whenever you make a change to your products. Then monitor the reactions of your customers. Recalibrate with careful consideration. 
	- **Complaints of Expectation**: occur when what you provide doesn’t meet your claims. And it’s your problem, not the customer’s. Make sure your products/services are used *as intended*, ***then***, honestly analyze your operations or marketing to see what went wrong.
	- **Complaints of Void**: expose opportunities. Observe the patterns for this type of complaint, and you'll get free ideas for new products.
	- **Complaints of Fraud**: are designed to exploit the business owner. They're haters. Typical human nature. Don't let your emotions get into this. Respond once (if they have the potential to damage your authority) *with grace*, explain your position, and move on.
- ==Treat complaints as a collection of patterns, not as individuals==. Keep a track record of similar complaints. Address them accordingly. Better products produced better customers, and better customers paid more.
- Solve complaints that add the most value while helping the most.
> "I don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please **everybody**”.
- Fanatical customer service can overcome shortcomings, but fanatical features can’t overcome poor customer service.
- Spectacular product features can’t overcome poor service.
- Be creative to craft a superior *Unexpected* customer service. To create raving customers, you must exceed satisfaction. Good customer service is strong leverage for word-of-mouth.
- Word of mouth, or [[#Authority |social proof]], is the best advertising there is. The ROI on happy customers is exponential.
# Partnership
- Choose partners who seek synergy, _**not**_ diversification of risk, expense, and workload.
	- If each partner looks to the other for the burden to bear, and when one bears more, resentment builds. That'll never end well.
- Investigate and interview your accountants and attorneys. Get referrals from successful, established entrepreneurs.
> [!important]- Trust
> You must make your trust an asset to be earned by others. Let actions speak louder than words. 
> When you allow words to disarm your trust, you become vulnerable to attack.
> _**Verify first, trust later**_. Trust no one but give everyone the opportunity to prove trust
- Your employees drive the public’s perception of your company. 
- Exponential business growth is fueled by fanatical customer service, and your frontline employees must integrate your vision. Nothing overcomes poor human experiences.
> Everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying: "I'm different. Make me feel important". Never forget that message when working with people.
## Competition
- If your preoccupation is with every single thing your competition does, you’re cheating your business and your customers.
- Forget about your competition 95% of the time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate your business. Mine their weaknesses and add value [[WIL from books#Rule 4 Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated |where they aren’t]]. Uncover unfulfilled needs. What could be better?
- When you fill needs and your army of customers grows, something suddenly happens: Everyone follows you.
