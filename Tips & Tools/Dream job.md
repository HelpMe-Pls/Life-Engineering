# Quotes
- I know that I wanted to work somewhere (small) where I would be rewarded for being hungry.
- At this specific stage in my career, I'm not gonna kill myself for a job.
# Actionable steps
- Get specific about what you really want (i.e. niche down): the specific role/title/responsibilities, specific perks/location about the job
	- Then, rank them in order of significance, e.g. Junior/Mid Fullstack Software Engineer $\gt$ Backend Engineer $\gt$ Frontend Engineer
	- Tie them into your current season (growth/lifestyle/reinvention) to niche down even further
	- Research (reach out to those people who are working - ideally alumni/former employee - at your dream company and ask them out, get the intel on what it's like working there)
		- If you're looking at a former employee's profile, also have a look at their entire career progression and see if any of those companies interest you
	- Networking (make use of your existing network and/or get in touch with the employers that you want to work for and pitch them yourself)
		- Find the experts: filter by industry + role + people on LinkedIn, prioritize warm connections (1st and 2nd degree). Aim for _**at least**_ 5 people per week. First send them an email, if no response within 2 days, message them on LinkedIn, if ghosted for 2 more days, message on other platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,...)
		- Reach out on Monday or Tuesday (ideally). Arrange calls or meetings (the more the better)
		- Once you're on the live conversation, craft your questions in a way that they show ==care _**about them**_==. Then try to find common ground and share your experience along the way.
	- Test the market (spar interviews)
	- Narrow down those few companies that fit you and focus on them
- Embrace impermanence: The best thing you can do is make the optimal decision for you today, and then have confidence in yourself that if and when your needs change, you will be able to *adapt* down the road.
# Red flags 
- If they're looking a some kind of 'A-team' or 'hit the ground and running', then just get tf outta there asap. 
- Their JD is generic and you just can't make out what specific type of employee they're looking for.
# JD & Resume
- It is essential to pick out the bullet points that have higher impact and align with your strength so then you can craft your narrative around them.
