# Quotes
- I know that I wanted to work somewhere (small) where I would be rewarded for being hungry.
- At this specific stage in my career, I'm not gonna kill myself for a job.
# Actionable steps
- Get specific about what you really want (i.e. niching down): the specific role/title/responsibilities, specific perks/location about the job
	- Then, rank them in order of significance, e.g. Junior/Mid Fullstack Software Engineer $\gt$ Backend Engineer $\gt$ Frontend Engineer
	- Tie them into your current season (growth/lifestyle/reinvention) to niche down even further
	- Research (reach out to those people who are working - ideally alumni/former employee - at your dream company and ask them out, get the intel on what it's like working there)
		- If you're looking at a former employee's profile, also have a look at their entire career progression and see if any of those companies interest you
	- Networking (make use of your existing network and/or get in touch with the employers that you want to work for and pitch them yourself)
		- Find the experts: filter by industry + role + people on LinkedIn, prioritize warm connections (1st and 2nd degree). Aim for _**at least**_ 5 people per week. First send them an email, if no response within 2 days, message them on LinkedIn, if ghosted for 2 more days, message on other platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,...)
		- Reach out on Monday or Tuesday (ideally). Arrange calls or meetings (the more the better)
		- Once you're on the live conversation, craft your questions in a way that they show ==care _**about them**_==. Remember, you're adding value, not pestering them. Try to find common ground and share your experience along the way.
	- Test the market (spar interviews)
	- Narrow down those few companies that fit you and focus on them
- Embrace impermanence: The best thing you can do is make the optimal decision for you today, and then have confidence in yourself that if and when your needs change, you will be able to *adapt* down the road.
# Red flags 
- If they're looking a some kind of 'A-team' or 'hit the ground and running', then just get tf outta there asap. 
- Their JD is generic and you just can't make out what specific type of employee they're looking for.
# Profile
- Keep in mind that your resume is not all there is. It's your network that helped you land your dream job to begin with. So put your effort in building your network before even thinking about this.
## JD
- It is essential to pick out the bullet points that have higher impact and align with your strength so then you can craft your narrative around them.  
## Resume
- Your resume **_must_** gracefully answer these 2 questions: "Who are you?" and "==**_What_**== can you do for me?"
- A narrative is a 1-2 sentences impression _about you_ that someone forms after a quick glance at your resume. A recommended formula to build your narrative: "_I'm _`...`, the `[your ideal role]` _who can help you_ `...`"
- Choose your narrative then **_craft the bullet points around it_**. For example: "_I'm Khoi and I'm interested in technology and user experience with experimental knowledge in software engineering._"
- Bullet points should be specific (credibility markers), quantitative, and express impact (what ==tangible value== does it bring) with descriptive words.
> [!info]- Ideal situation
> You should have around 5 versions of your resume that are tailored to the corresponding JDs of your selected dream companies.
## Cover letter
- The purpose of it is to answer the question: "_==**Why**== should someone interview you for this job_?" or "_Why should they care?_"
- It's similar to [[Writing#The structure |copy writing]], but the product is you and your expertise.
- Your narrative should be [[Writing#Why |precise]] and [[Entrepreneurship#Persuasion |persuasive]]. Get into their minds to see what they want by doing your research on their JDs.
- Again, this is about _your story_, so craft your words in a way that evokes emotions. The reader should **_feel_** something (good) reading your letter. Show some personality, avoid clich√©s and robotic phrases. Make it _**==memorable and relevant==**_ to the role that you're applying to.
- Turn their problems into rhetorical questions so that the hiring manager can nod along. These questions should feel like you're addressing their "pain point" and act as cohesive device for your next statements. Show your ambition and will to solve their problems.
