## SEO
- Good SEO helps Google leverage a site's ranking and reliability.
- Several ways to improve SEO:

#### Meta 
- Contains the keywords about the site:
```HTML
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
```
- You'll want around 5 keywords for each page.

#### Regular Updates
- The more recently your site has been updated, the higher it will rank in the results.
- You should aim to update your site’s content about once per week or more.

#### Backlinks
- A backlink is a link that goes to your page from another site. If other sites are linking to your page, it shows Google that you probably have helpful, accurate information.
- The more reliable and successful the site that gives you a backlink is, the more that backlink will help your SEO.

#### Views
- It is what it is 
- Use the Open Graph tags to improve the site's apperance on social media, so you can get more views:
```HTML
<meta property="og:url"               content="http://www.nytimes.com/arts/international/when-great-minds.html" />

<meta property="og:type"               content="article" />
<meta property="og:title"              content="When Great Minds Don’t Think Alike" />
<meta property="og:description"        content="How much does culture influence creative thinking?" />
<meta property="og:image"              content="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/19/arts/international/19iht-btnumbers19A/19iht-btnumbers19A-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" />
```

#### Bounce Rate
- It is the percentage of people who come to your site but only visit one page before leaving. 
- Google sees a high bounce rate as an indication of an unattractive website.
- To reduce bounce rate: include similar articles at the end of each blog or page, suggesting other pages the user may find interesting.

#### Optimize for Your Local Area
- If you’re a local business rather than online only, you want to optimize your site for your local area.
- Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are prominently displayed and consistent throughout your site.
- It’s important to make sure Google Maps shows your correct contact information.
