## Overview
A typical web application is made up of:
-   **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with your application.
-   **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
-   **Data Fetching** - where your data lives and how to get it.
-   **Rendering** - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
-   **Integrations** - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
-   **Infrastructure** - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
-   **Performance** - how to optimize your application for end-users.
-   **Scalability** - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
-   **Developer Experience** - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.
