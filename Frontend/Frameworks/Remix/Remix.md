- Remix is actually a fullstack framework. We can explicitly label a module as server-only by creating a file with `.server` in the name.
- With Remix you can create a special route that has some UI associated to it. Encapsulating your data requirements with the UI that requires it and being able to share that around as just a component is incredibly powerful.
