# Quotes
- Anything that makes your code easier to understand and ***predictable*** makes it possible to build a more ambitious system.
- The skill of programming is the skill of building programs that don’t confuse yourself. The best programs are those that manage to do something interesting while still being easy to understand.
- A programming style that computes new values instead of changing existing data is recommended. If a piece of code stops running in the middle of creating a new value, no existing data structures were damaged, making it easier to recover.
- For problems that are _expected_ to happen during routine use, crashing with an unhandled exception is a terrible strategy.
- You are a dynamic, ever-changing being—and that should be embraced, not rejected. Embrace new information and experiences as _software updates_ to your brain.
