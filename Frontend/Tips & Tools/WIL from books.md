# Beyond Order
## Rule 1: Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative achievement 

- People remain mentally healthy not mearly because of the integrity of their own minds, but because they are constantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by those around them.

- The best player is therefore not the winner of any given game but, among many other things, he or she who is invited by the largest number of others to play the most extensive series of games.

- Someone who is sophisticated as a winner wins in a manner that improves the game itself, for all the players.

- Genuine authority constrains the arbitrary exercise of power.

- Every rule was once a creative act, breaking other rules. Every creative act, genuine in its creativity, is likely to transform itself, with time, into a useful rule.


## Rule 2: Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that

- You do not chose what interest you. It chooses you. Something manifests itself out of the darkness as compelling, as worth living for; following that, something moves us further down the road, to the next meaningful manifestation - and so it goes, as we continue to seek, develop, grow and thrive. It is a perilous journey, but it is also the adventure of our lives. 

- What is interesting and meaningful (and novel and unexpected, as those all go together) manifests itself in a form that is both dangerous and promising, particularly when its grip is intense and irresistible.

- Every story requires a starting place that is not good enough and an ending place that is better. Nothing can be judge in the absence of that end place, that higher value. Without it, everything sinks into meaninglessness and boredom or degenerates and spirals into terror, anxiety, and pain.

- Aim at something. Pick the best target you can currently conceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way, face them, and correct them. Get your stories straight.


## Rule 3: Do not hide unwanted things in the fog

- Life is what repeats. And it's worth getting what repeats right. 

- It is difficult to win an argument, or even begin one, if you have not carefully articulated what you want (or do not) and need (or do not).

- With careful searching, with careful attention, you might tip the balance toward opportunity and against obstacle sufficiently so that life is clearly worth living, despite its fragility and suffering. 
  But there will be times in your life when it will take everything you have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace with.


## Rule 4: Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated

- What is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The highest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the highest possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of responsibility - and this includes the responsibilities that others disregard or neglect.

- It is a bad idea to sacrifice yourself uncomplainingly so that someone else can take the credit. Nonetheless, under such circumstances - if you're a wise and attentive person - you might still notice that your unproductive coworkers are leaving a plethora of valueable tasks undone.
 
- You could start by trying to solve a small problem - something that is bothering you, that you think YOU could fix. You could start by confronting a dragon of just the size that you are likely to defeat. Under reasonable circumstances, picking up the excess responsibility is an opportunity to become truly invaluable.

- It appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is to be found in the adoption of responsibility. In your experience, has doing something easy been worthwhile ? Well, no, not very often. Then perhaps what you really want is something difficult. It is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place limitiations on ourselves. We narrow and limit ourselves, and explore the possibilities thereby revealed. That is what makes the game.

- Accept some limitations, however, and the game begins. Accept them, more broadly speaking, as a necessary part of Being and a desirable part of life. Assume you can transcend them by accepting them. And then you can play the limited game properly.

- You must sacrifice something of your manifold potential in exchange for something real in life. Aim at something. Discipline yourself. Or suffer the consequence.

- We are well advised to take on challenges at precisely the rate that engages and compels alertness, and forces the development of courage, skill, and talent, and to avoid foolhardy confrontation with that which lies beyond current comprehension.

- When you face a challenge, you grapple with the world and inform yourself. This makes you more than you are. It makes you increasingly into who you could be. The ultimate question of Man is not who we are, but who we could be.

- Even under the best of all conceivable circumstances, almost insupearble obstacles will emerge and obstruct your path. The encouragement? You will have the opportunity to reveal yourself as much stronger and more competent than you might imagine.

- Here is what the future means: If you are going to take care of yourself, you are already burdened (or priviledged) with a social responsibility. The you for whom you are caring is a community that exists across time. The necessity for considering this society of the individual, so to speak, is a burden and an opportunity that seems uniquely characteristic of human beings.

- And then you determine to start acting in accordance with your conscience. You decide that it is a partner, despite its adversarial form. You put all that you have discovered to be right into action, and you begin your ascent. You start to monitor yourself, ever more careful to ensure you are doing the right thing - listening to what you say, watching yourself act, trying not to deviate from the straight and narrow path. That becomes your goal.

- It is probable - inevitable - that the adventure of your life will frustrate and disappoint and unsettle you, as you heed the call of conscience and shoulder your responsibility and endeavor to set yourself and the world right. But that is where the deep meaning that orients you and shelters you to be found.


## Rule 5: Do not do what you hate

- We do the things we do because we think those things important, compared to all the other things that could be important. We regard what we value as worthy of sacrifice and pursuit. That worthiness motivates us to act, despite the fact that action is difficult and dangerous.

- Without careful attention, culture itself tilts toward corruption. Tyranny grows slowly, and asks us to retreat in comparatively tiny steps. But each retreat increases the possibility for next retreat.
  Better to stand forward, awake, when the costs are relatively low - and, perhaps, when the potential rewards have not yet vanished. Better to stand forward before the ability to do so vanished.

- Part of moving Beyond Order is understanding that your conscience has a primary claim on your action, which supersedes your conventional social duty.
  If you have acted honorably, so that you are a trustworthy person, it will be your decision to refuse to comply or to act in a manner contrary to public expectation that will help society itself maintain its footing.

- But you need to win the lottery once, and a few years of difficulty with hope beat an entire dejected lifetime of a degenerating and oppressed career.

- Maybe following the dictates of conscience is in fact the best possible plan that you have - at minimum, otherwise you have to live with your sense of self-betrayal and the knowledge that you put up with what you truly could not tolerate. Nothing about that is good.


## Rule 6: Abandon ideology

- Helping people bridge the gap between what they profoundly intuit but cannot articulate seems to be a reasonable and valuable function for a public intellectual.

- It might be that the true meaning of life is available for discovery, if it can be discovered at all, by each individual, alone - although in communication with others, past and present.
  It may well be, therfore, that the true meaning of life is not to be found in what is objective, for example, but what is subjective (but still universal).

- The meaning that sustains life in all its tragedy and disappointment is to be found in shouldering a noble burden.

- Beware of intellectuals who make a monotheism out of their theories of motivation. Beware, in more technical terms, of blanket univariate (single variable) causes for diverse, complex problems.

- It is much safer morally to look to yourself for the errors of the world, at least to the degree to which someone honest and free of willful blindness might consider.

- It is probable that your own imperfections are evident and plentiful, and could profitably be addressed, as step one in your Redeemer's quest to improve the world.
  It is much more psychologically appropriate (and much less dangerous socially) to assume that you are the enemy - that it is your weaknesses and insufficiencies that are damaging the world - than to assume saintlike goodness on the part of you and your party, and to pursue the enemy you will then be inclined to see everywhere.

- Like God, however, ideology is dead. The bloody excesses of the twentieth century killed it. We should let it go, and begin to address and consider smaller. more precisely defined problems. We should conceptualize them at the scale at which we might begin to solve them, not by blaming others, but by trying to address them personally while simutaneously taking responsibility for the outcome.

- Have some humility. Clean up your bedroom. Take care of your family. Follow your conscience. Straighthen up your life. Find something productive and interesting to do and commit to it. When you can do all that, find a bigger problem and try to solve that if you dare. If that works, too, move on to even more ambitious projects. And, as the necessary beginning to that process...abandon ideology.


## Rule 7: Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens

- Human beings are conscious during the day, when it is light. Much of that consciousness is visual and therefore dependent on light. To be illuminated or enlightened is to be exceptionally awake and aware - to attain a state of being associated with divinity.

- Without clear, well-defined, and noncontradictory goals, the sense of positive engagement that makes life worthwhile is very difficult to obtain. Clear goals limit and simplify the world, as well, reducing uncertainty, anxiety, shame, and the self-devouring physiological forces unleashed by stress.

- To move forward with resolve, it is necessary to be organized - to be directed toward something singular and identifiable. Aim. Point. All this is part of maturation and discipline, and something to be properly valued.

- To write something long, sophisticated, and coherent means, at least in part, to become more complex, articulate, and deeper in personality.

- It is far better to become something than to remain anything but become nothing. This is despite all the genuine limitations and disappointments that becoming something entaills. 

- Doubt about which game is appropriate right now is not relativism. It is the intelligent consideration of context. The fact that happiness is not appropriate, for example, at a funeral, does not mean that happiness itself lacks value.

- Spirit is the creative force that gives rise to what becomes dogma, with time. Spirit is also that which constantly transcends such time-honored tradition, when possible. It is for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a masterpiece, the creation of which signifies not only the acquisition of the requisite skill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new skills.

- If you work as hard as you can on one thing, you will change. You will start to also become one thing, instead of the clamoring multitude you once were. 
  That one thing, developed properly, is not only the disciplined entity formed by sacrifice, commitment, and concentration. It is that which creates, destroys, and transforms discipline itself - civilization itself - by expressing its unity of personality and society. It is the very Word of truth, upon whose function all habitable order, wrenched out of chaos, eternally depends.


## Rule 8: Try to make one room in your home as beautiful as possible

- Making something beautiful is difficult, but it is amazingly worthwhile. If you learn to make something in your life truly beautiful - even one thing - then you have established a relationship with beauty.
  From there you can begin to expand that relationship out into other elements of your life and the world. That is and invitation to the devine. That is the reconnection with the immortality of childhood, and the true beauty and majesty of the Being you can no longer see. You must be daring to try that.

- A real piece of art is a window into the transcendent, and you need that in your life, because you are finite and limited and bounded by your ignorance. Unless you can make a connection to the transcendent, you will not have the strength to prevail when the challenges of life become daunting.

- Beauty can help us appreciate the wonder of Being and motivate us to seek gratitude when we might otherwise be prone to destructive resentment.

- The unknown manifests itself to you in the midst of the known. That revelation - sometimes exciting, but often quite painful - is the source of new knowledge.

- Beauty leads you back to what you have lost. Beauty reminds you of what remains forever immune to cynicism. Beauty beckons in a manner that straightens your aim. Beauty reminds you that there is lesser and greater value.
  Many things make life worth living: love, play, courage, gratitude, work, friendship, truth, grace, hope, virtue, and responsibility. But beauty is among the greatest of these. 


## Rule 9: If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and completely

- Learn from the past. Or repeat its horrors, in imagination, endlessly. We must recollect our experiences and derive from them their moral.
  It is a psychological truism that anything sufficiently threatening or harmful once encountered can never be forgotten if it has never been understood.

- To orient ourselves in the world, we need to know where we are and where we are going. Where we are: that concept must optimally include a full account of our experience of the world to date. Where we are going: that is the projection of our ultimate ideal - by no means simply a question, say, of accomplishment, love, wealth, or power, but development of the character that makes all fortunate outcomes more likely and all unfortunate outcomes less likely.
  We use our map to guide our movement, and we encounter successes and obstacles along the way.

- The successes are both confidence building and exhilarating. Not only are we moving toward our ultimate desire, we appear to be doing so properly (and are therefore not only moving ahead but validating our map). The obstacles and failures are, by contrast, anxiety provoking, depressing, and painful. They indicate our profound ignorance. They indicate that we do not understand with sufficient depth where we have been, where we are, or where we are going. They indicate that something we have built with great difficulty and wish above all to protect is flawed - to a degree both serious and not fully understood.

- We do not appear to ourselves to be driven by the past, in some fundamentally deterministic manner, like a mechanical clock in which the spring drives the gears that turn the hands and tell the time. Instead, when we decide, we actively confront the future. We seem destined to face something akin to unformed potential and to determine what will emerge as the present - and then the past.

- Actions based upon the desire to take responsibility; to make things better; to avoid temptation and face what we would rather avoid; to act voluntarily, courageously, and truthfully - these make what comes into Being much better, in all ways, for ourselves and for others, than what arises as a consequence of avoidance, resentment, the search for revenge, or the desire for mayhem. Everyone seems to know this. We are universally tormented by our consciences for what we know we should have done yet did not do. We are tormented equally by what we did but know we should not have done.

- It is that combination of Truth, Courage, and Love comprising the Ideal, whose active incarnation in each individual does in fact take the potential of the future and make the best of it.

- It is not the expression of emotion associated with unpleasent events that has curative power. It is the development of a sophisticated causal theory: Why was I at risk? What was it about the world that made it dangerous? What was I doing or not doing to contribute to my vulnerability? How can I change the value hierachy I inhibit to take the negative into account so that I can see and understand it? How much of my old map do I have to let crumble and burn - with all the pain dying tissue produces - before I can change enough to take my full range of experience into account? Do I have the faith to step beyond what should and must die and let my new and wiser personality emerge? To some degree, we are our assumptions. They structure the world for us.

- We have every reason to avoid facing the bitter truth. But making what is - and what was - clear and fully comprehended can only protect us. If you are suffering from memories that will not stop tormenting you, there is a possibility - possibility that could be your salvation - waiting there to be discovered.


## Rule 10: Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship

- For each person is in truth an unfathomable enigma. With care, you might keep rediscovering, in the person you have chosen, enough residual mystery to maintain the spirit that first brought you together.
  With care, you can avoid stowing each other away in a conveniently sized box, punishment at hand should either of you dare to emerge, and contempt for the consequent predictability you both now face lurking not so far beneath the surface.

- If you are fortunate, you might rekindle that glimpse you had when you first were attracted to each other, of what your life could be like if you were better people than you are. That is what happens when two people fall under the spell of love. For a while, both become better than they were, and see that, but then that magic fades away. Both receive that experience as a gift. Both have their eyes open and see what is visible to no one else. 
  Such love is a glimpse of what could be, if the relationship remained true. It is delivered as a gift initially, from fate, but requires tremendous effort to realize and maintain. And once that is understood, the goal is clear.

- If you have solved the problem of knowing what you want, admitted it to yourself in a verbalizable form, and let someone else know your wishes, you have then granted them a dangerous source of power. The person whom you have made your confidant is now in a position to fulfill your desires, but could equally deprive you of what you want, embarrass you for wanting it, or hurt you in some other manner, because you have now made yourself vulnerable.

- Trust between people who are not naive is a form of courage, because betrayal is always a possibility, and because this is conciously understood. To trust is to invite the best in your partner to manifest itself, with yourself and your freely given trust as enticement.

- You cannot maintain trust in yourself if you lie. You cannot maintain trust in yourself, likewise, if you act in a manner that would require a lie if it was discovered.

- Life is too difficult to negotiate alone. If you tell your partner the truth, and you strive to act so that you can tell the truth about how you act, then you have someone to rely on when the seas become high and your ship threatens to founder. This can literally be a matter of life or death. In a relationship where romance remains intact, trust must be king.

- So, what is the superordinate principle to which both marital partners must bow? It is not illumination as mere verbal abstraction. It is not that they are only supposed to think and speak the truth. It is that they are supposed to act it out. And that is the ancient idea that the Word should be made flesh.

- Both should be oriented toward the most positive future possible, and agree that speaking the truth is the best pathway forward. That orientation and truthfulness will engender a transformative dialogue, verbal and nonverbal, if the partners in the arrangement commit to abiding by the consequence of that dialogue. Voluntary subordination to this higher order principle of illumination both unifies and revitalizes.

- There is an inevitable yearning in our natures for the completion that someone else might provide. There is a sense that you are missing something, otherwise, and that only the proper romantic union will provide it. It is true, too - you are indeed missing something, If you were not, sex would never have evolved. 
  The entire biological course of our destiny, since reproduction progressed past the mere division of cells, appears driven by the fact that it was better for two dissimilar creatures to come together to produce a comparatively novel version of themselves than to merely clone their current embodiment.

- If you are on your own, you are inevitably lopsided, one-sided. That is often not for the best.

- The question is, "What is going to make you desperate enough to negotiate?" And that is one of the mysteries that must be addressed if you wish to keep the romance alive in your relationship.

- The part that wants to avoid is the part that gets angry. There is a part that wants to talk, too, and settle the issue. But doing so is going to be cognitively demanding, ethically challenging, and emotionally stressful. In addition, it is going to require trust, and people test trust, not least by manifesting anger when approached about something touchy to determine if the person daring the approach cares sufficiently to overcome a serious barrier or two or three or ten to get to the horrible bottom of things. And avoidance followed by anger is not the only trick in the book.

- Tears are an effective defense mechanism, as it takes a heart of stone to withstand them, but they tend to be the last-ditch attempt at avoidance. If you can get past tears, you can have a real conversation, but it takes a very determined interlocutor to avoid the insult and hurt generated by anger (defense one) and the pity and compassion evoked by tears (defense two). It requires someone who has integrated their shadow (their stubbornness, harshness, and capacity for necessary emotionless implacability) and can use it for long term benefit. Do not foolishly confuse "nice" with "good".

- Hope, of course, can drive us through the pain of negotiation, but hope is not enough. You need desparation, as well, and that is part of the utility of "till death do us part". You are stuck with each other, if you are serious - and if you are not serious, you are still a child. That is the point of the vow: the possibility of mutual salvation, or the closest you can manage here on Earth.

- You can keep the possibility of escape in the back of your mind. You can avoid the commitment of permanence. But then you cannot achieve the transformation, which might well demand everything you can possibly muster. Remember: the difficulty implicit in the negotiation carries with it a tremendous promise, which is part of a radically successful life: *You could have a marriage that works*.

- You do not have a life with someone when you have an affair with them. You have an endless array of desserts (at least in the beginning), and all you have to do is scoop the whipped cream off the top of each of them and devour it. That is it. You see each other under the best possible conditions, with nothing but sex on your minds and nothing else interfering with your lives. As soon as it transforms from that into a relationship that has any permanency, a huge part of the affair immediately turns right back into whatever it was that was bothering you about your marriage. An affair is not helpful, and people end up horribly hurt. Particularly children - and it is to them you owe primary allegiance.

- Romance is play, and play does not take place easily when problems of any sort arise. Play requires peace, and peace requires negotiation. And you are lucky even then if you get to play.

- Here is a rule: do not ever punish your partner (or anyone) for doing something you want them to continue doing. Particularly if it took some real courage - some real going above and beyond the call of duty - to manage.

- Devote yourself to the higher ideal upon which an honest and courageous relationship is necessarily dependent, and do that with the seriousness that will keep your soul intact. Maintain your marital vows, so that you are desperate enough to negotiate honestly. Do not let your partner brush you off with protestations of ignorance of refusal to communicate. Do not be naive, and do not expect the beauty of love to maintain itself without all-out effort on your part. Distribute the requirements of your household in a manner you both find  acceptable, and do not tyrannize or subject yourself to slavery. Decide what you need to keep yourself satisfied both in bed and out of it.


## Rule 11: Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant

- The great experimenters and scientific writers I have known are passionate about their pursuit. Something emotional drives them. They hope that their learning (disinterested though it may be, as at present it has no specific aim except that of learning) will have some genuinely positive outcome: making the world a better place. That provides the entire pursuit with a narrative element, the motive that accompanies any good plot, and the transformation of character that makes up the best of stories.

- We conceptualize what we experience as a story. That story is, roughly speaking, the description of the place we are at right now, as well as the place that we are going to, the strathgies and adventures that we implement and experience along the way, and our downfalls and reconstitutions during that journey.

- There is an idea embedded deep within the human psyche that potential can be a place of maximal horror, home to an infinite predator - or an infinite variety of predators.

- You understand that, because life is not as good as it could be, and because you are going to die. Obviously, under such conditions, you should learn more. So, you are driven to explore. The fundamental representation of reality, as an eternal treasure house guarded by an eternal predator, is therefore a prefect representation of the way you are wired to react to the world at the most fundamental depths of your Being.

- The dream serves as the first cognitive step in transforming the unknown into actionable and even articulable knowledge (in the wake of basic emotional, motivational, and bodily reactions such as fear or curiosity or freezing). The dream is the birthplace of the thought, and often of the thought that does not come easily to the concious mind. The dream is not hiding anything; it is just not very good at being clear (although that certainly does not mean that it cannot be profound).

- It is difficult for any of us to see what we are blinded to by nature of our personalities. It is for this reason that we must continually listen to people who differ from us, and who, because of that difference, have the ability to see and to react appropriately to what we cannot detect.

- So, there exists a hero and an adversary; a wise king and a tyrant; a positive and negative maternal figure; and chaos itself. That is the structure of the world in six characters (with the strange seventh of chaos is some sense the ultimate birthplace of all the others). It is necessary to understand that all seven exist, and that they are all existential pernaments - elements of experience with which every soul, rich, poor, blessed, cursed, talented, dull, male or female, must inevitably contend. That is life - *they* are life.

- If you confront the suffering and malevolence, and if you do that truthfully and courageously, you are stronger, your family is stronger, and the world is a better place. The alternative is resentment, and that makes everything worse.

- Arrogance and deceit unite to oppose the idea that courageous truth aimed at love creates the Good, and conspire to replace it with the idea that any whim, large or small, has the right and opportunity to reveal itself for purposes that are instead narrow and self-serving.

- There appear to be two broad forms of deceit: sins of commission, the things you do knowing full well they are wrong; and sins of omission, which are things you merely let slide - things you know you should look at, or do something about, but do not.

- The first conspiracy between deceit and arrogance might be regarded as a denial or rejection of the relationship between divinity, truth, and goodness.
  The second form of arrogance that enables deceit has something to do with the attempted theft of the power of divinity itself. The liar acts out the belief that the false world he brings into being, however temporarily, will serve at least his own interests better than the alternative.
  The third form of arrogance that underlies deceit has to do with the belief that the deceiful act (which, as we already discussed, has bent or warped the structure of reality) will stand on its own powerfully, without being revealed and destroyed as reality itself straightens and reforms, as it inevitably will.
  The fourth form of arrogance that justifies deceit has to do with a warped sense of justice, often brought about by resentment. People employ deception in this fourth set of circumstances because they are resentful and angry about their victimized positions in the hell and tragedy of the world.

- If you take your turn at the difficult tasks, people learn to trust you, you learn to trust yourself, and you get better at doing difficult things. All of that is good.
  "It does not matter if I take the easy path", is true only if there is no personality element of the speaker that could be called forth be a true adventure. And those who avoid their destiny by standing back when asked to step forward also deprive everyone else of the advantages that may have come their way had the person who took the easy way instead determined to be all they could be.

- If you understand that deception corrupts and distorts the function of the most fundamental instinct that guides you through the difficulties of life, that prospect should scare you enough so that you remain careful in what you say and do.
  If you deceive (particularly yourself), if you lie, then you begin to warp the mechanisms guiding the instinct that orients you. That instinct is an unconcious guide, so it works underneath your cognitive apparatus, especially once it has become habitual. 
  If you rewire the unconcious mechanisms that maintain you with assumptions derived from something you know to be unreal, then your meaningful instinct will take you to places you should not go, in proportion to its corruption.
  There is little more terrifying than the possibility that you could come to a crisis point in your life when you need every faculty you possess, at that moment, to make the decision properly, only to find you have pathologized yourself with deceit and can no longer rely on your own judgment. Good luck to you, because nothing but luck will then serve to save you.

- We wake up in the morning and confront the day, with all its possibilities and terrors. We chart a course, making decisions for better or worse. We understand full well that we can do evil and bring terrible things into Being. But we also know that we can do good, if not great, things. We have the best chance of doing the latter if we act properly, as a consequence of being truthful, responsible, grateful, and humble.

- Perhaps you could live in a manner whose nobility, grandeur, and intrinsic meaning would be of sufficient import that you could tolerate the negative elements of existence without becoming so bitter as to transform everything around you into something resembling hell.
  What if we could constrain our malevolence a bit more, serve and transform our institutions more responsibly, and be less resentful? God only knows what the ultimate limit to that might be.


## Rule 12: Be grateful in spite of your suffering

- The fact of your voluntary focus on the abyss, so to speak, indicates to yourself at the deepest of levels that you are capable of taking on without avoidance the difficulties of existence and the responsibility attendant upon that.
  That mere act of courage is deeply reassuring at the most fundamental levels of psychological being.

- Beginning to cease knowingly lying is a major step in the right direction.

- It is easy for optimism to be undermined and demolished, however, if it is naive, and for cynicism to arise in its place. But the act of peering into the darkness as deeply as possible reveals a light that appears unquenchable, and that is a profound surprise, as well as a great relief.

- You cannot properly appreciate what you have unless you have some sense not only of how terrible things could be, but of how terrible it is likely for things to be, given how easy it is for things to be so. This is something that is very much worth knowing. Otherwise you might find yourself tempted to ask, "Why would I ever look into the darkness?"

- Strength in the face of death is better for the person who is dying and for those who remain living alike.
  To understand clearly that you are morally obliged under such circumstances to manifest strength in the face of adversity is to indicate to yourself - and, perhaps, to other people - that there is something in you of sufficient grandeur and power to face the worst forthrightly and yet to prevail. That is certainly what people need to encounter at a funeral.

- If you can observe someone rising above the catastrophe, loss, bitterness, and despair, then you see evidence that such a response to catastrophe is possible. In consequence, you might mimic that, even under dire circumstances. Courage and nobility in the face of tragedy is the reverse of the destructive, nihilistic cynicism ofter justified under just such circumstances.

- To be grateful for your family is to remember to treat them better. They could cease to exist at any moment. To be grateful for your friends is to awaken yourself to the necessity of treating them properly, given the comparative unlikelihood of friendship itself. To be grateful to your society is to remind yourself that you are the beneficiary of tremendous effort on the part of those who predeceased us, and left this amazing framework of social structure, ritual, culture, art, technology, power, water, and sanitation so that our lives could be better than theirs.

- If you are attentive and awake, and you can see the structure of the world, bitterness and resentment beckon as a viable response. Then you might well ask yourself, "Well, why not walk down that dark path?". It seems to me that the answer to that, to state it again, is courage: the courage to decide "No, that is not for me, despite the reasons I may have for being tempted in that direction", and to decide, instead, "Despite the burden of my awake mortality, I am going to work for the good of the world."

- It is within the frame of that impossible undertaking - that decision to love - that courage manifests itself, enabling each person who adopts the courageous pathway to do the difficult things that are necessary to act for the good in even the worst of times. If you determine to manifest the two virtues of love and courage - simutaneously, consciously - you decide that you are going to work to make things better and not worse, even for yourself, even though you know that because of all your errors and omissions you are already three-quarter lost.

- There is a deep part of us that makes the decision, when we grieve for someone we have lost, that their experience was worthwhile, despite it all. Maybe that is the reflection of an even more fundamental decision: Being itself is worth having, despite it all. Gratitude is therefore the process of conciously and courageously attempting thankfulness in the face of the catastrophe of life. Maybe that is what we are trying to do when we meet with our families during a holiday, wedding, or funeral. Those are often contentious and difficult affairs.

- So, you might love people despite their limitations, but you also love then *because* of their limitations. That is something very much worth understanding. Doing so may help you see how gratitude remains possible. Despite the fact that the world is a very dark place, and that each of us has our black elements of the soul, we see each other in a unique blend of actuality and possibility that is a kind of miracle: one that can manifest itself, truly, in the world, in the relationships we have that are grounded in trust and love. That is something for which you can courageously thankful. That is something in which you can discover part of the antidote to the abyss and the darkness.
	  Be grateful in spite of your suffering.
