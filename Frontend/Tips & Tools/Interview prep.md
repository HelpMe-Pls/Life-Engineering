## Before the interview
- The most important takeaway is that “every interview is a learning process”. It is essential to realize that even if you are well-suited to a position, there is always the possibility that a more experienced candidate is also being interviewed. So, even though you did not get a role, you could still have had a good interview.
- Regardless of the outcome, always ask yourself, did I present myself to the best of my ability? And, can I learn things from this interview that can help me in subsequent interviews?
- Pride in appearance can be equated with pride in a role.
- If you're unsure whether or not the interview will be technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what position your interviewer holds (or what the interview might cover). An engineer will usually perform a technical interview.
- You typically do one or two screening interviewers before being brought on-site.
- [Do your research](https://www.experis.com/en/insights/articles/2021/05/25/20-tips-for-great-job-interviews), figure out what problems their business is trying to solve. It'd be great if you can offer specific improvements and/or alternate approaches, better yet, their trade offs as well (e.g. have a closer look at [this UI](https://peeba.com/hk/en/) and maybe suggest better layout/UX/etc. >> Get refractoring UI)
- Many ***startups*** might post job listings, but for the hottest startups, often *the best way in is through a personal referral*. This reference doesn't necessarily need to be a close friend or a coworker. Often just by reaching out and expressing your interest, you can get someone to pick up your resume to see if you're a good fit.


## During the interview
- Listen until the question is finished, and take a breath.
- Display pride in previous work-related experiences you've had. And have some questions [[Interviewer questions |prepared]]. Take this time to learn something about what is being sought. What conditions might be more favorable for you? Are the company's goals aligned with yours, and can you convey that?
- Annual Bonus: Annual bonuses at tech companies can range from anywhere from 3% to 30%. Your recruiter might reveal the average annual bonus, but if not, check with friends at the company.
- Consider the "happiness" factor: 
	- The Product: are they crafting art of just getting shit done ?
	- Manager and teammates: it's best to directly meet them and ask about their impression on the job/company
	- Company Culture: how decisions get made, to the social atmosphere, to how the company is organized. Ask your future teammates how they would describe the culture.
	- Work hours: work life balance, is OT well compensated or is the company expecting you to be ready for the job at all time ?
- Salary: have a *specific* "Ask": It's more effective to ask for an additional  `$6996`  in salary than to just ask for "more" or give the range.
- Choose companies/teams that resonate with what you value. The aim of an interview is to find a good match between the company and the candidate.



## After the interview
- Interviewers assess you *relative to other candidates* on that same question by the same interviewer. It's a *relative* comparison.
- If you haven't heard back from a company within ***3 - 5*** business days after your interview, check in (politely) with your recruiter.
- Establishing a friendly, engaging conversation with your interviewers is your ticket to future job offers.
- If you're still waiting to hear back from other companies, you can ask for an extension. Usually these deadlines are one to four weeks out
- Rejected, ask for feedback like: "Is there anything you'd suggest I work on for next time?". If you comeback to give it another shot, ask: "What are some of the most impressive achievements of your team/company for the last `x` months (since our last meeting) ?"
