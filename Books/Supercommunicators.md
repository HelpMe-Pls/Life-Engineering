- The most important goal of any conversation is to ==_connect_==.
- It's all about recognizing that we need to be engaged in the same _kind_ of conversation, at the same time, if we want to connect.
- For the most meaningful discussions, it is crucial to have a "==learning conversation==". We all want meaningful conversations.
- Every discussion is influenced by ==emotions==, no matter how rational the topic at hand. Emotions help us connect.

# The guidelines
- **Pay attention** to what kind of conversation is occurring.
- **Share** your goals, and **ask** what others are seeking.
- Ask about others' **feelings**, and share your own.
- **Explore** if identities are important to this discussion.

# Three kinds of conversations
- Miscommunication occurs when people are having different _kinds_ of conversations.
- Effective communication requires _recognizing_ what _kind_ of conversation is occurring, and then _matching_ each other.
> It is important to note that matching **isn't** mimicry. Rather, it's understanding someone's mindset, and **thinking** about how to **show empathy**.
> We need to prove to others that we are listening closely. It requires explaining clearly how we, ourselves, are thinking and making choices, so that others can match us is return.
- Within every conversation there is a quiet _negotiation_, determining what everyone wants, so that something meaningful can occur.
## What's this really about
- First, recognize that this is ==a negotiation==:
	- An important task in any negotiation is _asking_ lots of questions.
	- How much of someone's decision depended on their own desires versus what people around them wanted?
	- You _don't_ want to begin a negotiation assuming you know what the other side wants.
- Second, figure out what does everyone ==want==:
	- Ask _open-ended questions_ designed to get them talking about their values and what the wanted out of life, and then listen closely.
	- It's an _invitation_ for people to tell you who they are.
	- Someone will make an invitation, and their partner will accept or make counter-invitations.
- Then, _how_ will we ==make choices _**together**_==.
	- The best negotiators didn't battle over who should get the biggest slice of pie. Rather, they focused on making the pie itself larger. It's an act of creativity.
	- Begin by demonstrating that you appreciate theirs.
- Understanding the difference between the practical _logic of costs and benefits_ and the empathetic _logic of similarities_ was critical.
### Logic of costs and benefits
- Lean into data and reasoning.
- They're agreeing to contrast potential costs with hoped-for benefits.
- Ask yourself, "What does someone like me usually do in a situation like this?"
- They want to draw on their _experiences_, even if they don't completely overlap with the situation at hand.
- In these kinds of conversations, facts are less persuasive.
### Logic of similarities
- Lean into stories and compassion.
- In an empathetic mindset we are influenced be narratives.
### Ask questions
- Ask them about their experiences:
	- What was it like to....
	- Tell me about...
- Ask them to make a judgement:
	- How'd you decide...
	- What do you like about...
	- What advice would you give...
	- What's the best/worst thing about...
- Get creative. Try interrupting, and then not interrupting. Give a matching response to their outputs.

## How do we feel
- It's about getting everyone to talk about more intimate things. Reciprocating vulnerability. Vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned.
- When something is interesting, you listen without thinking about it.
> If we acknowledge someone else's **==vulnerability==**, and become vulnerable in return, we expose something that opens us to others' judgements. That's how we build trust, understanding, and connection.
- Laughter is one way of proving that we hear how someone feels. When people genuinely laughed together, their mood and energy almost always matched.
- When you describe how you feel, you're giving someone a map of the things you care about.
- Human typically synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them.
- People don't announce their emotions. They perform them.
- Saying things aloud that "leave people feeling more vulnerable to others' evaluations," causes participants to feel "more connected," "more caring," and "to listen attentively."  
> [!important]- Mood and Energy
> - What matters isn't speaking and acting alike, but rather matching one another in ways that convey the ***desire*** to align. Make it obvious you are ***working*** to understand their emotions.
> - Mood and energy are non-linguistic tools for creating emotional connection.
> - Pay attention to someone's mood (Do they seem negative or positive?) and their energy level (Are they high energy or low energy?). Then, focus on matching those two attributes.
### Questions
- Questions that pushed people to describe their beliefs, values, or meaningful experiences tended to result in emotional replies, even if the questions themselves didn't seem all that emotional. 
- The difference between a shallow question and one that sparks an opportunity for emotional connection is _vulnerability_.
- Ask them _how_ they're feeling about their life, their experiences, and then follow up with statements/questions that *reveal your own emotions*; **rather than talking about the facts**.
	- Invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change.
> [!info]- Find the common ground
>- Follow up questions should allow self-disclosure without it seeming like self-obsession.
>- Ask people how they feel and reciprocate the vulnerability they share with us.
>- Ask honest questions. and become vulnerable enough to reveal feelings that, if you were lucky, lead to finding common emotional ground.
### Connecting amid conflicts
- Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it.
- Work together to determine if there are any "zones of possible agreement," and arrive at a mutual understanding about why this dispute matters, and what's needed for it to end.
> [!info]- Emotions
> - We learn why we are fighting by discussing emotions. If we can't talk across our differences, we can't make decisions together.
> - Emotional intelligence comes from showing someone we have heard their emotions, proving we want to see things from their perspective by ***looping for understanding***.
> - ==Trying to force someone to listen, or see our side, only inflames the battle.==
> - When you start to understand each other's stories, that's when you can start talking about what's actually going on.
- Happy couples tended to focus on controlling themselves, their environment, and the conflict itself.
- Happy spouses find things they could control ***together***. When you prove to someone you are *listening*, you are, in effect, giving them some control over the conversation. 
- ***Listening*** means letting someone else tell their story and then, even if you don't agree with them, trying to understand why they feel that way.
> Find specific points of agreement. Remind everyone that, though we have differences, we want to be ***aligned***.

> [!important] Your goal is to understand, and be understood, rather than to win.
#### Responding to emotions
- Repeat back, in your own words, what you heard. Distill another person's thoughts in your own language, show them that you're working hard to see their perspective.
- We reciprocate vulnerability by:
	- Looking for what someone needs (comfort, empathy, advice, love,....)
	- Asking permission (e.g. "Can I share how I've seen others handle this?", "Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?",...)
	- Matching in return (describe honestly how you feel about them/the conversation, being emotionally available, listening to how someone feels and what they need, and sharing our own emotional reactions.) 

## Who are we
- If a speaker said something that lumped a listener into a group against her or his will, the discussion would likely go south.
- With anger and alienation, a conversation fell apart.
- The listener, offended, would become defensive as their sense of self - their identity - was attacked.
### Acknowledgement
- Sometimes just acknowledging someone's experience and feelings can make a big difference. 
- Just because we're worried about a conversation, that doesn't mean we ought to avoid it.
- Remind ourselves why this conversation matters and we can diminish our anxieties by acknowledging, to ourselves and others, that these conversations may be awkward at first, but will get easier.
- Before any challenging conversation, think for a few moments about:
	- What you hope will happen
	- Who is the person with the least power (they should speak first)
	- What might go wrong (and how you will react when it does)
	- Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue?

> [!info]- When they talk about their struggles
> - We must not give in to the temptation to minimize someone's struggles, or try to solve their problems, simply because witnessing their discomfort is so difficult. 
> - When they talk about something painful, just listen. Don't try to solve or diminish.
### Guidelines for hard conversations
- Talk about boundaries (when you're unsure if something is offensive, ask for their permission).
- Acknowledge discomfort.
- We will make mistakes: the aim is ***not** perfection*, but curiosity and understanding.
- Share *your* experiences and perspective, ==*without* blaming, shaming or attacks==.
- Confidentiality is important (their secrets will be safe with you).
- Respect is essential.
- Sometimes we just need to pause: go slow. Blatant painful/traumatic expressions are the signal to stop.
> All of us can recognize the sting of exclusion. This commonality, instead of dividing us, can help us empathize.
### Keep in mind
- If you're trying to say the perfect thing, nothing authentic is going to happen.
- Perfection is not the goal. You're inviting people to participate and learn, to take responsibility for improving things.
- You have to contribute, rather than just criticize.
- When we create space to discuss conflicting beliefs, we make connection more likely.
- Identify emotional goals, practical goals and group goals. Keep acknowledging that discomfort is natural and useful.
### During the discussion
- **Draw out multiple identities**: we all contain multiple selves, none of us is one-dimensional. Ask people about their backgrounds, communities they belong to, and causes they support.
- **Equal footing**: seek to frame topics so everyone is an expert, or everyone a novice.
- **Look for genuine similarities**: use common ground to understand each other better. Even if we don't have similarities, simply acknowledging others' experiences - showing you have heard them - can create a sense of oneness. 
- **Manage your environment**: shift the conversation to what feels safe, and who feels welcomed. When an environment makes someone feel left out, it can determine our sense of security.
# Happiness
- Having loving parents made it easier to find happiness as an adult. A lifelong commitment to learning, also provide a leg up.
- The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest (mentally and physically) at age 80.
> The most important influence, by far, on a flourishing life is love.
- Happy people engaged in many, many conversations over the years that brought them closer to others.
> [!important]- What's important
> - What's important is ***wanting*** to connect, ***wanting*** to understand someone, ***wanting*** to have deep conversations, even when it is hard and scary, or when it would be so much easier to walk away.
> - Achieving connection - authentic, meaningful connection - is the most important thing in life.
