# Overview
- Implement the mindset of no excuses and no one else to blame. Leaders must own everything in their world. Leaders is truly and ultimately responsible for everything. There is no one else to blame.
	- If anyone was to be blamed and fired for what happened, let it be me.
- There can be no leadership where there is no team. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader.
- Leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory, particularly when doubters whether victory is even possible.  
- The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it.
	- Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interest.
	- When personal agendas become more important than the team and the overarching mission's success, performance suffers and failure ensues.
	- The leader must explain not just what to do, but *why*.
	- The best leaders checked their egos, accepted blame, sought out constructive criticism, and took detailed notes for improvement.

> [!important]- Key takeaways
> - A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.
> - Building leaders underneath you to take over your job, which should always be your goal as a leader, and you should expect that of them. You get better at the job so they trust you and move on.
# Plan
- The planning process and briefing must be a forum that encourages discussion, questions, and clarification from even the most junior personnel.
- Leaders must ask questions of their troops, encourage interaction, and ensure their teams understand the plan. Leaders must routinely communicate with their team members to help them understand their role in the overall mission.
	- It requires personally engaging in face-to-face conversations with direct reports and observing the frontline troops in action to understand their particular challenges and read them into the Commander's Intent.
- Focus on those risks that actually can be controlled. Focus efforts on the best course of action.
- Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation.
- Analyze lessons learned and implement them in future planning.
- Good performance comes from rehearsal.
# Execute
- Relax. Look around. Make a call.
- It's about the mission and how best to accomplish it. The focus must always be on how to best accomplish the mission.
- If your team isn't doing what you need them to do, you first have to look at yourself.
# Motivation
- We needed to move. There was no time for a complex plan.
- Though the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, we collected valuable intelligence.
- Discipline creates vigilance and operational readiness, which translated to high performance and success on the battlefield.
- If there is not a strong enough correlation between the behavior and the reward or the punishment, then behavior will never be modified.
- It is such a good opportunity when you have a weak leader above you.
- Motivate yourself! Take charge of things. Take advantage of it. Make things happen. It's awesome to have a weak leader.
# Winning the war within
- The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.
- Good leaders don't make excuses. Instead, they figure out a way to get it done and win.
- Taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage.
- Your people don't need to be fired. They need to be led. You have to own it.
- Leaders must enforce standards. Leaders should never be satisfied.
- Every leader must be able to detach from the immediate tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals.
	- It is the responsibility of the subordinate leader to reach out and ask if they do not understand.
- One way to build trust: do what you say and say what you do.
- How do you regain trust with people? Tell them the truth.
- It's actually a sign of insecurity if you can't ask when you need help with something.
# The laws of combat
- Cover and Move, Simple, Prioritize and Execute, and Decentralized Command.
- When no options were good options, we had to choose the least bad option.
- It's up to you to inform them and help them understand some of the challenges you are dealing with here on the ground.
## Cover and Move
- One element must cover so that the other element could move. All teams working together in support of one another.
- Cover and Move means teamwork. If the overall team fails, everyone fails, even if a specific member or an element within the team did their job successfully.
- You must work together and support each other as *one* team. Make them a part of your team, not an excuse for your team.
## Simple
- You must brief to ensure the lowest common denominator in the team understands. They need to understand it to a point that they don't need to be thinking about it to understand it.
- It is critical to keep plans and communication simple.
## Prioritize and Execute
- Leaders must determine the highest priority task and execute.
- The team must maintain the ability to quickly reprioritize efforts and rapidly adapt to constantly changing battlefield.
- Prioritize your problems and take care of them one at a time, the highest priority first. 
- Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed.
## Decentralized command
- First, blame yourself. The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is try to avoid taking blame for it.
- Work hard. Treat people with respect. Weigh decisions carefully.
- Every tactical-level team leader must understand not just what to do but *why they are doing it*.
- Be proactive rather than reactive.
- Leaders must be free to move to where they are most needed, which changes throughout the course of an operation.
- Don't micromanage them, but give them clear guidance about what the expectations are.
- Open conversations build trust. Overcoming stress and challenging environments builds trust. Working through emergencies and seeing how people react builds trust.
- Leaders must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities.
- When the boss makes a mistake but then owns up to that mistake, it doesn't decrease respect. Instead, it increases respect for that leader, proving he or she possesses the humility to admit and own mistakes and, most important, to learn from them.
- The subordinate leader must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication, and maintain the highest professionalism.
- Leading people is the most challenging and, therefore, the most gratifying undertaking of all human endeavors.
> Don't ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do.
# Decisiveness amid Uncertainty
- Part of being decisive was knowing and understanding that some decisions, while immediately impactful, can be altered or reversed; other decisions, like shooting another human being, cannot be undone.
- Instead of letting the situation dictate our decisions, we must dictate the situation. 
	- If you don't make the hard decision, you will be hurting the people you care about, not helping them.
- As a leader, you want to be seen – you need to be seen – as decisive, and willing to make tough choices.
- When someone is not leading you, then you lead them. You pick up the slack for their weakness.
# The Dichotomy of Leadership
- The only way you could make time, was to get up early. That took discipline.
- Discipline was really the difference between being good and being exceptional.
- When you have the discipline to get up early, you are rewarded with more free time.
- A unit that has tighter and more-disciplined procedures and processes will excel and win.
- A person's biggest strength can be his greatest weakness when he doesn't know how to balance it.
- A leader must lead but also be ready to follow. A true leader is not intimidated when others step up and take charge.
- A leader must be aggressive but not overbearing.
- A leader must be calm but not robotic. People do not follow robots. Leaders who lose their temper also lose their respect.
- A leader must be confident but never cocky. A leader must be brave but not foolhardy.
- Leaders must have a competitive spirit but also be gracious losers.
- A good leader does not get bogged down in the minutia of a tactical problem at the expense of strategic success.
- Leaders must be humble but not passive; quite but not silent.
- Leaders must never get so close that the team forgets who is in charge.
> A leader has nothing to prove but everything to prove.
- ==Last, and perhaps most important, when things went wrong and the fog of war set in, we fell back on our disciplined procedures to carry us through the toughest challenges on the battlefield.==
# Extra
- It means so much when one of your people comes and talks to you and you sit down and say "Okay, let me take some notes on what you're saying."
- What you're trying to do in a leadership position: build relationships. That's what business is. That's what combat leadership is. That's what life is.
- The people that really follow you are the people that you have real relationships with.
- You build relationships by respecting people. By being humble. By listening. By telling them the truth.
	- Even if someone doesn't know what the truth is, they definitely know when they're not getting the truth.
- When things do go right, you pass the reward and the credit on to your team. That also helps you build relationships.
- Being truthful and honest doesn't give you permission to be a jerk. You've got to be a chess player, not a checkers player. You've got to influence people.
- Be humble. Listen. Respect people up and down the chain of command. Take input but be decisive. Be honest while being tactful. Stay balanced.
- When balance is lost, leadership suffers and the team's performance rapidly declines.
- Using the indirect approach is generally more successful. And it's the same thing with leadership.
- There is a knowledge base that you should acquire very quickly when you take on a new leadership position. So put in the work to learn, and then apply common sense.
	-  You don't have to know every single thing about a particular job that you're going into. You don't need to know everything.
	- People will actually respect that you are asking good questions and that you want to learn.
	- Showing that you can admit that you don't know everything isn't going to hurt your reputation. It is actually going to help your reputation.
- If your boss is so cowardly that he tries to pin a serious incident on you, you cannot allow that.
- You want to make sure that you aren't stepping up *and stepping on* your leader. You don't want to step into their spotlight. You don't want to impose yourself in their leadership limelight and glory. 
	- It is the insecure leader that you need to watch out for. The insecure leader is always worried about looking bad.
	- If the team looks good, then the leader looks good. And you want to make your boss look good. You really do.
	- You give them the plan, but you are letting them think it is theirs by appearing to seek guidance or approval.
