# Overview
- Implement the mindset of no excuses and no one else to blame. Leaders must own everything in their world. Leaders is truly and ultimately responsible for everything. There is no one else to blame.
	- If anyone was to be blamed and fired for what happened, let it be me.
- There can be no leadership where there is no team. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader.
- Leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory, particularly when doubters whether victory is even possible.  
- The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it.
	- Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interest.
	- When personal agendas become more important than the team and the overarching mission's success, performance suffers and failure ensues.
	- The leader must explain not just what to do, but *why*.
	- The best leaders checked their egos, accepted blame, sought out constructive criticism, and took detailed notes for improvement.
> A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.

# Execute
- Relax. Look around. Make a call.
- It's about the mission and how best to accomplish it. The focus must always be on how to best accomplish the mission.

# Motivation
- We needed to move. There was no time for a complex plan.
- Though the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, we collected valuable intelligence.
- Discipline creates vigilance and operational readiness, which translated to high performance and success on the battlefield.

# Winning the war within
- The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.
- Good leaders don't make excuses. Instead, they figure out a way to get it done and win.
- Taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage.
- Your people don't need to be fired. They need to be led. You have to own it.
- Leaders must enforce standards. Leaders should never be satisfied.
- Every leader must be able to detach from the immediate tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals.
	- It is the responsibility of the subordinate leader to reach out and ask if they do not understand.

# The laws of combat
- Cover and Move, Simple, Prioritize and Execute, and Decentralized Command.
- When no options were good options. We had to choose the least bad option.
## Cover and Move
- One element must cover so that the other element could move. All teams working together in support of one another.
- Cover and Move means teamwork. If the overall team fails, everyone fails, even if a specific member or an element within the team did their job successfully.
- You must work together and support each other as *one* team. Make them a part of your team, not an excuse for your team.
