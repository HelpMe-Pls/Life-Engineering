- We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways:
	1. By creating a work or doing a deed
	2. By experiencing something or encountering someone
	3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering
# Love
- Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.
- The salvation of man is through love and in love.

# Sufferings
- Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as a meaning of sacrifice.
- To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.
- There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.
- There was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.

# Hope
- Humor was another of the soul's weapons in the fight of self-preservation.
- The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living.
- The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.
- What matters is to make the best of any given situation.
- Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!
- Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.

# Mindfulness
- Human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.
- Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand.
- No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.
- The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.
- Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered.
- The place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation.
- In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured.
- Persons facing difficult choices may not fully appreciate how much their own attitude interferes with the decision they need to make or the action they need to take.
- It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.
- He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.
- The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.
