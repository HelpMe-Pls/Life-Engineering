# What negotiation is about
- It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted.
- Negotiation is a psychological investigation. It serves two distinct, vital life functions - information gathering and behavior influencing.
- Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties.
- Negotiation is often called _=="the art of letting someone else have your way"==_.
- Top negotiators know that conflict is often the path to great deals. And the best find ways to actually have fun engaging in it.
- You don't need to like it; you just need to understand how the world works.
- Being right isn't the key to a successful negotiation - having the right mindset is.
- No communication is always a bad sign. In this world, ==_you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly_==.
- Don't treat others the way you want to be treated; _==treat them the way they need to be treated==_.
- _==No deal is better than a bad deal.==_ Once you're clear on what your bottom line is, you have to be willing to walk away. _==Never be needy for a deal.==_
- At the end of the day, the deal killers often are more important than the deal makers.
- The most vital principle to keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an enemy.
	- The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue.
> Just remember, to successfully negotiate it is crucial to prepare. When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion; you fall to your highest level of preparation.

# Techniques
## Mirroring
- Realize this: we engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. 
- We are easily overwhelmed; everyone just listening to the voice in their head.
> It begins with listening, making it about other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.
### Use your voice
- The body language and tone of voice – not words – are our most powerful assessment tools.
- When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations just seem to flow.
- You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone's brain and flip an emotional switch. Use these 3 voices:
	- The late-night FM DJ voice
	- The positive/playful voice
	- The direct or assertive voice
> [!info] Chill tf out
>- The key here is to _==relax and smile while you're talking==_. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: _I'm in control._
>	- Use your name to introduce yourself. _==Say it in a fun, friendly way. Let them enjoy the interaction, too.==_ And get your own special price.
>	- Smiling can also become a habit that makes it easy for you to mask any movements you've been caught off guard.
>- Your attitude is light and encouraging. Create safety by a tone of voice that says _"I'm okay, you're okay, let's figure things out."_
>- Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.
- We copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice.
	- It's a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.
	- _==We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar.==_

> [!important] How it works
> - A "mirror" is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said.
> - For a mirror to be effective, you've got to let it sit there and do its work. _==It needs a bit of silence (at least 4 seconds)==_.
> - The intention behind most mirrors should be "Please, help me understand."

> When another person's tone of voice or body language is inconsistent with his words, a good mirror can be particularly useful.

## Labeling or Accusation Audit
- Emotions aren't the obstacles, they are the means.
- _==Human connection is the first goal.==_ The more you know about someone, the more power you have. 
- Your act of recognizing the incongruence and gently dealing with it through a label will make them feel respected.
	- By acknowledging the other person's situation, you immediately convey that you're listening.
- Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. _==It's about understanding them.==_ It's a powerful mood enhancer.
- Think of tactical empathy as an extension of natural human interactions and not artificial conversation tics.
- Encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human interaction.

> [!important] How it works
> - Labels help to uncover and identify the _primary **emotion**_ driving almost all of your counterpart's behavior.
> - The underlying feeling is what motivates the behavior.
> - We spot their feelings, turn them into words, and then very calmly and respectfully repeat their emotions back to them.
> - The trick to spotting feelings is to _pay close attention_ to changes people undergo when they response to external events. Most often, those events are _your words_.

- Once you've thrown out a label, _==be quiet and listen==_. A label's power is that it invites the other person to reveal himself. 
- Labeling negatives diffuses them (or defuses them, in extreme cases). Labeling positives reinforces them.
### Tips for labeling
- Try not to attach your identity when labeling their feelings:
	- The word "I" gets people's guard up. Prefer _"**It** sounds/seems like..._" over _"**I'm** hearing that..."_
	- You can always step back and say, "I didn't say that was what is was. _I just said **it** seems like that._"
	- Don't be demoralized if this process seems to go slowly.
> Use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.
#### Dealing with negativity
- Anger is rarely productive - in you or the person you're negotiating with. Anger also reduces our cognitive ability.
- The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to _==acknowledge the negative and diffuse it==_.
	- The phrase _"Look I'm an asshole"_ is amazingly effective to make problems go away. Here you can pause briefly, letting them recognize and appreciate your attempts to understand what they're feeling.
	- The best way to deal with negativity is to _==observe it, without reaction and without judgment==_.
	- Following the heels of an argument is a great position for a negotiator, because your counterpart is desperate for an empathetic connection.
### Accusation audit
- Listing every terrible thing your counterpart _could_ say about you. _==Heading off the accusation before it could be made==_.
- These accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.
- The beauty of going right after negativity is that is brings us to a safe zone of empathy.

## Reframe rejection 
- We've instrumentalized niceness as a way of greasing the social wheels, yet it's often a ruse.
- Pushing hard for "Yes" doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side.
	- For good negotiators, "No" is pure gold.
- "Yes" and "Maybe" are often worthless. But "No" always alters the conversation. Learn how to hear it calmly.
	- _=="No" is the **start** of the negotiation, not the end of it.==_.
	- _=="No" means that you're making progress, so you're "**one step closer**"==_.
	- "No" is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain status quo. It gives you time to elaborate or pivot in order to convince your counterpart that the change you're proposing is more advantageous than the status quo.
- Your invitation for the other side to say "No" has an amazing power to bring down barriers and allow for beneficial communication.
	- People have a need to say "No". So don't just hope to hear it at some point; get them to say it early.
	- By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you.
- To almost everyone – "No" means one thing: end of discussion. But that's not what it means.
	- Train yourself to hear "No" as something other than rejection, and response accordingly. Most of the time, it means:
		- _"I want something else."_
		- _"Wait, I'm not comfortable with that."_
	- Human beings are innately jealous.
- There are actually three kinds of "Yes": Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment.
- "No" starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final "Yes" of commitment. _==An early "Yes" is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.==_
	- "Yes" is the final goal of a negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start. 
	- "Yes" is nothing without a "How". Questions, always questions. Answering questions gives them the illusion that they have control of the negotiation.

> [!info]- It's about control
> - In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result comes from someone else's decision.
> - Everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you're in the door.
> - "No" helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decision.
### Tips
- Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.
	- _==Ask them questions that open paths to your goals.==_
- Good negotiators welcome – even invite – a solid "No" to start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking.
	- The first and most common "No" without using the word is to ask _"How am I supposed to `do that`?"_
	- Some version of _"Your offer is very generous, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me"_ is an elegant second way to say "No".
	- Then you can use something like _"I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that."_
	- Verbally, it should be delivered with a _==downward inflection and a tone of regard==_.
	- "Strategic umbrage" can wake your counterpart to the problem. Saying _"I'm sorry that just doesn't work for me."_ with poise, works.
- The sooner you say "No", the sooner you're willing to see options and opportunities that you were blind to previously.
	- _=="No" protects and benefits all parties in an exchange==_. It's a requirement to implementable success. It's a pause, a nudge, and a chance for the speaker to articulate what they do want.
	- _==Triggering "No" peels away the plastic falsehood of "Yes" and gets you to what's really at stake.==_
- If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise "No"-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away.
	- Something like _"Have you given up on `this project`?"_ works wonders.
#### Get them to say "No"
- There's a big difference between making your counterpart feel that they can say "No" and actually getting them to say it.
	- One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other party's emotions or desires.
	- Another way to force "No" in a negotiation is to _==ask the other party what they don't want==_.
- "No"-oriented questions and plays on your counterpart's natural human aversion to loss. _==No one likes to be abandoned.==_

## Summarize
- The sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually "_==That's right==_".
- Before you convince them to see what you're trying to accomplish, you have to say the things to them that will get them to say _"That's right"_.
	- "That's right" is great, but if "You're right", nothing changes.
- _==Summary = paraphrasing + labeling==_. Use a summary to trigger a "That's right".
- One crucial aspect of any negotiation is to figure out how your adversary arrived as his position.

> [!info]- It's about constructive behavior
> - When your adversaries say "That's right", they feel they have assessed what you've said and pronounced it as correct of their own free will. They embrace it.
> - Humans have an innate urge towards socially constructive behavior. 
> - The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.


## Reframe "fair" 
- We compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise to be safe.
	- You've got to embrace the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are, and that's what great negotiators do.
	- If there's one way to put off your counterpart, it's by implying that disagreeing with you is _unfair_.
- When the negotiation is over for one side, it's over for the other too.
- If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong.
- We're all irrational, all emotional. Emotion is a necessary element to decision making that we ignore at our own peril.
	- While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, _==the actual decision making is governed by emotion.==_
	- All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface.
### Tips
- The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion.
	- Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think – or are told – they will.
	- How close we were getting to their self-imposed deadline would be indicated by how specific the threats were that they issued.
	- Corporate salespeople work on a quarterly basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a close.
- _==Hiding a deadline means you're negotiating with yourself, and you always lose when you do so.==_ 
	- You may see that you have more to accomplish than time will actually allow before the clock runs out.
- _==Don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides.==_ The art of closing a deal is staying focused to the very end. 
	- There are crucial points at the finale when you must draw on your mental discipline.
#### Bring their guard down
- If you noticed that they're overwhelmed or frustrated, don't get suckered into a concession. Instead, _==stand you ground with accusation audit==_:
	- "Okay, I apologize. Let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it."
	- "I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it."
- As a negotiator, you should strive for a reputation of being fair. Your reputation precedes you. Let it precede you in a way that paves success.
	- _==Start with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears.==_
#### Negotiate a better salary
- Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations.
- When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your "real" offer seems reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive.
- Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that _`someone else` might charge_.
- If you offer a range (and it's a good idea to do so), expect them to come in at the low end.
- The _odd numbers_ gave them the weight of thoughtful calculation.
- _==See what valuable nonmonetary gems they might have that are cheap to them but valuable to you.==_
	- The more you talk about nonmonetary terms, the more likely you are to hear the full range of their options. If they can't meet your non-salary requests, they may even counter with more money.
- Once you've negotiated a salary, make sure to define success for your position – as well as metrics for your next raise.
- Sell yourself (and your success) as a way _they_ can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company.
	- Ask: _"What does it take to be successful here?"_
	- The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed.
### Emotional framing
- If you can get at what people are _really_ buying – then you can _sell them a vision_ of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution.
	- _==Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.==_
#### Loss aversion
- The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain.
- In a tough negotiation, it's not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want.
	-  _==To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.==_

## Calibrated Questions
- Successful negotiation involved in getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself. 
	- Remove aggression from conversations by acknowledging the other side openly, without resistance.
	- All negotiations, done well, should be an information-gathering process that vests your counterpart in an outcome that serves you.
- You just have to have an idea of where you want the conversation to go when you're devising your question.
> [!important] The illusion of control
> - The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.
> - One of the GOAT calibrated questions: ==_"How am I supposed to `do that`?"_==. You're asking for their advice and giving them the illusion of control.
- You don't directly persuade them to see your ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas. 
	- _==It's not to get others believing that we say. It's just to stop them unbelieving.==_
	- Asking for help – is one of the most powerful tools for suspending belief.
> He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.
### How does it work
- The calibrated open-ended question takes the aggression out of a confrontational statement or close-ended request that might otherwise anger your counterpart.
	- They allow you to introduce ideas and requests without sounding overbearing or pushy.
- Calibrated questions have the power to educate your counterpart on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by _telling_ them what the problem is.
- You want what the other guy wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem.
- Without self-control and emotional regulation, it doesn't work.
	- If you can't control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party?
### Tips
- You can _==use "**what**" and "**how**" to calibrate nearly any question==_. Even something as harsh as "Why did you do it?" can be calibrated to _"What caused you to do it?"_ which takes away the emotion and makes the question less accusatory.
	- Asking "How" keeps your counterparts _engaged but off balance_.
	- Questions like _"**What** are we trying to accomplish here?"_ or _"**What** else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?"_ are great ways to refocus your counterpart when you feel you're being pulled into the compromise trap.
- _==Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right.==_
- Avoid questions that can be answered with "Yes" or tiny pieces of info. 
- A repetitive series of "What" and "How" questions can help you overcome the aggressive tactics of a manipulative adversary.
- _==If you're not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.==_
	- If you're hearing a lot of "I", "me", and "my", the real power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of "we", "they", "them", it's more likely you're dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.
- If you're working to lure a client away from a competitor, you might say, _"**Why** would you ever do business with me? Why would you ever change from your existing supplier? They're great!"_
- Use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to _==get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times==_.
#### How to spot a liar
- _==It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.==_ The number of words grow along with the lie.
- Liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. 

## Bargain Hard
- Self-esteem is a huge factor in negotiation, and many people set modest goals to protect it.
- Remember, _==never be so sure of you want that you wouldn't take something better.==_
- _==People who expect more (and articulate it) get more.==_
- People who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don't set goals or simply strive to do their best.
- The key to begin a haggle is to rattle the other guy ever so gently. You do it in the nicest way possible.
- _==Any response that's not an outright rejection of your offer means that you have the edge.==_
- To be great you have to add to your strength, not replace them.
### The Ackerman Bargaining
- People getting _concessions_ often feel better about the bargaining process than those who are given a single firm, "fair" offer. 
- Set boundaries, and ==_learn to take a punch or punch back, **without anger**_==.
- Before heading into the weeds of bargaining, you'll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. 
- ==Decreasing raises and _ending on non-round numbers_==. Let's say you're dealing for a discount, start from 65% of your target price, and then go up to 85% → 95% → 100% of your number:
	- If you're negotiating your salary, and you want `100k`: 
		- First offer: 135k 
		- First concession: 115k
		- Second concession: 105k
		- Final offer: 103.5k (_pause for about 5s_ before delivering this number, using a non-round number to convey thoughtfulness and signal that you're at your limit)
	- ==_Ask for nonmonetary offers_ (or willing to walk away) if they're breaking through 100% of your number.== With the example above, politely walk away if they offer `95k` (which means that now you're at -105% of your target number)

## The Black Swan
- The Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on previous experience.
	- Because we don't know where the treasure is, we don't know where to dig.
	- Black Swans are leverage multipliers. _==Leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain.==_
	- What really matters in the leverage _they think_ you have on them.
	- _==The party who feels they have more to lose and are the most afraid of that loss has less leverage, and vice versa.==_
	- To get leverage, you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through.
- We must never over value our experience or undervalue the informational realities served up moment by moment in whatever situation we face.
- _==You must open yourself up to the factual reality that is in front of you.==_
- The moment when we're most ready to throw our hands up and declare "They're crazy!" is often the best moment for discovering Black Swans that transform a negotiation.
	- People operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information.
### Three kinds of leverage
#### Positive
- It's your ability to provide – or withhold – things that your counterpart wants.
- _==We trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar.==_ 
- When you ascertain your counterpart's unattained goals, invoke your own power and follow-ability by expressing passion for their goals – and for their ability to achieve them. 
- If you get it right, you'll go from a situation where you want something from your counterpart to a situation where you _both want_ something from each other.
#### Negative
- Getting a good deal may push us toward making a risky bet, but saving our reputation from destruction is a much stronger motivation.
	- The most effective method is to gather it from interactions with your counterpart.
	- People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy. They'll at least act irrationally and shut off the negotiation.
- Sentences like _"**It** seems like you don't care what position you are leaving me in"_ can really open up the negotiation process.
#### Normative
- If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage.
- You want to see what "language" they speak, and speak it back to them.
	- It's not how well you speak but how well you listen that determines your success.
- By positioning your demands within the worldview your counterpart uses to make decisions, you show them respect and that gets you attention and results.
### Don't take it personally
- Your counterpart will often reject offers for reasons that have nothing to do with their merits.
- They are simply complying with needs and desires that you don't yet understand, what the world looks like to them based on their own set of rules. Your job is to bring these Black Swans to light.
### Get face time
- Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research.
- Email gives them too much time to think and re-center themselves to avoid revealing too much.
- Say something like _"**Would it be a bad idea** for me to take you to your favorite steak house and we just have a few laughs, and we don't talk business?"_ to get your face time.
- The only way the process was going to move forward is through direct human interaction.
- During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between.
- It's our innate human desire to get along with other members of the tribe. You are also leading them to examine and articulate what they want and why and how they can achieve it.

# Preparation
## The Goal
- _**Write down**_ your optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly.
- Carry the written goal into the negotiation.
## Summary
- _==You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a "That's right".==_
	- If they don't, you haven't done it right.
## Labels/Accusation Audit
- Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit. Remember to not attach your identity to the labels:
	- _"**It seems like** `something` is valuable to you."_
	- _"**It seems like** you don't like `something`."_
	- _"**It seems like** you are worried that `something`."_
	- _"**It seems like** `something` would make it easier.."_
	- _"**It seems like** you're reluctant to `do something`."_
## Calibrated Questions
- Delve into their underlying motivations (_what_ is making them want what they want). 
	- Motivations are what they are worried about and what they hope for, even lust for.
- We tend to limit our field of vision to our issues and problems, and forget that the other side has its own unique issues based on its own unique worldview.
  - _==Never forget that a loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain.==_
  - Questions to identify deal killers:
	  - _"**How** does this affect the rest of your team?"_
	  - _"**What** do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?"_
	  - _"**What** is the **biggest** challenge you are facing?"_
	  - _"**How** does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on?"_
- Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their answers.
## Non-cash Offers
- Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your counterpart that would be available.
- Ask yourself: _"**What** could they give that would almost get me to do it for free?"_
## AI Prompts
You are an AI negotiation coach inspired by Chris Voss’s approach and the techniques popularized in “Never Split the Difference” (tactical empathy, mirroring, labeling, calibrated questions, accusation audits, “no”-oriented questions, and clear BATNA thinking).

Important identity constraint:
- Do NOT claim you are Chris Voss or imply real-world affiliation with him.
- Do NOT fabricate personal stories, clients, or “as an FBI negotiator I…” claims.
- Instead, coach me using the principles and the communication style associated with his methodology.

Ethics + safety constraints:
- Do not encourage illegal behavior, threats, coercion, blackmail, deception, harassment, or impersonation.
- Do not propose lying or falsifying documents/messages. If I suggest something unethical, redirect to ethical alternatives.
- If the situation is high-stakes legal/medical/financial, remind me to consider professional advice.

Your mission:
Help me reliably get better outcomes (and preserve relationships where needed) in hard conversations/negotiations by:
1) clarifying my real goal(s) and constraints,
2) diagnosing the other side’s likely drivers (fears, incentives, status needs, constraints),
3) designing a strategy (prep, opening, exploration, proposal, closing),
4) producing word-for-word talk tracks and branching responses,
5) running a realistic roleplay with me,
6) debriefing and iterating until I feel ready.

Operating style (be Voss-like in delivery):
- Be calm, concise, and tactical. Use short lines. Late night FM DJ voice.
- Favor questions over statements.
- Use tactical empathy: demonstrate understanding before pushing.
- Use labels (e.g., “It sounds like…”, “It seems like…”, “It looks like…”), mirrors (repeat the last 1–3 critical words), and calibrated “what/how” questions.
- Avoid “why” questions unless you soften them (they can trigger defensiveness).
- Default to “getting to no” and “that’s right” moments rather than forcing agreement.
- Give me phrases that feel natural, not robotic.

Process:
A) Intake (ask only what you must, then start):

Start by asking up to 10 targeted questions to fill critical gaps. If I can’t answer, make reasonable assumptions and state them explicitly.

Your questions must cover:
- What is the relationship/history with the counterpart?
- What outcome do I want (ideal, acceptable, walk-away)?
- What does the counterpart want? What might they fear?
- Constraints: time, money, authority, policies, third parties.
- Power dynamics and leverage (including my BATNA and theirs).
- Communication channel (in-person/phone/email) and timeline.
- What I must NOT say/do (landmines).
- My style and their style (direct, emotional, analytical, etc.).

B) Output format (use this exact structure every time):

1) Situation Snapshot: 3–6 bullets summarizing facts + stakes.
2) Objectives: Ideal / Target / Acceptable / Walk-away (and define my BATNA).
3) Counterpart Analysis: likely motivations, constraints, objections; what they need to feel safe.
4) Strategy: phases (prep → opening → discovery → bargaining → close) with the main goal of each phase.
5) Accusation Audit: 5–10 lines I can say early to defuse negatives they might think about me.
6) Talk Tracks (word-for-word):

- Opening script (2 versions: warm/firm).
- 10–15 label lines tailored to this scenario.
- 10 calibrated questions tailored to this scenario.
- 6 “no”-oriented questions.
- 6 lines to regain control if they interrupt/stonewall.

7) Branching Playbook:

- If they say X → I say Y (at least 8 likely objections).
- “Stress responses”: what to say if they get angry, dismissive, or emotional.
- If they ask for a concession → how to trade (not give).

8) Deal Design:

- 3 package options I can propose (good/better/best) OR if it’s not a “deal,” 3 paths to resolution.
- What I can concede vs. what I must protect.
- Terms I should ask for that people often forget (“and then some”).

9) Practice Roleplay:

- You play the counterpart realistically (including pushback).
- I respond as me.
- After each of my messages, grade me (1–10) on: tone, empathy, leverage, clarity, and ask quality.
- Then give a “next best line” I could say.

10) Final 2-Minute Prep Card:

- 5 reminders, 5 lines to use, and 3 traps to avoid.

C) Rules during roleplay:
- Keep your counterpart messages short and human.
