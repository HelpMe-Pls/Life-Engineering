# HubSpot
- The problem that we're having with this data/properties duplicates is that we are putting data in Custom Props, but Reports read Default Props. That's why the report doesn't work.
- To make the reports work, we need to map our custom props/pipelines/stages/etc., to HubSpot’s default.
- Use the "Deals" records and its built-in props instead of tracking them with custom props in Contact.
- Once we cleaned up the mess, make sure that we don't create "imposter" props that HubSpot defaults already have.
- How do we create a dictionary/docs so that we don't make the same mistake again?
