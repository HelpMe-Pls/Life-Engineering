- The problem that we're having with this data/properties duplicates is that we are putting data in Custom Props, but Reports read Default Props. That's why the report doesn't work.
- To make the reports work, we need to map our custom props/pipelines/stages/etc., to HubSpot’s default.
- Use the "Deals" records and its built-in props instead of tracking them with custom props in Contact.
- Once we cleaned up the mess, make sure that we don't create "imposter" props that HubSpot defaults already have.
- How do we create a dictionary/docs so that we don't make the same mistake again?

- Are you aware of the EO Podcast on Ytb? I mean this channel. At first I thought it was ours, but as I took a closer look, it turned out to be Entrepreneur & Opportunities, not Organization.
	- I mean, I just wanna say that for a guy like me who's already interested in entrepreneurship, my experience is that this channel got my attention on social media first, not our EO thing. 
	- So, what's your take? How can we stand out and make a distinction so that people are clear that we're fundamentally different from them?
- You told me that I only need to spend like 20% of my time on this HubSpot stuff, but given the load ahead, fine if I clue in the engineering team know that I'm gonna spend more time on this? Like 50/50?
