- Thanks, `name`. Yesterday we wrapped up our first sprint for EOVN, made some good progress and finalized the requirements for Queensland and Bangkok rollouts.
- So for today I'll be working on those requirements, update the description for the existing workflows and segments to finalize them in the docs.
