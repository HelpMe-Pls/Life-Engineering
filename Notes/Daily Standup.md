- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Yesterday I set up the dashboards and reports for Queensland, and I also made a list of the properties we're still missing.
- So the main thing today for me is to keep working on the Queensland setup to add the missing props and reports, then clean up the Views and Segments.

> [!info] Intro
> - I'm a software engineer over at Edge8, and I also handle the technical support for any HubSpot issues that pop up in the EO Chapters.
> - I'm a technical guy, so I can't think of the top of my head  one thing that I need from group, but there's definitely one thing I need from myself is to better my communication. 
> - I'll try my best to be aligned with the team when it comes to the technical side of EO.
## Key metrics
- Chapters are able to track their two levers of growth, member retention and member acquisition with a goal of 8% net new growth every year.
	- The leading indicators of this is <u>data cleanliness</u> from our perspective and `number of leads` to `number of opportunities` from a deal funnel perspective → ==figure out the related deal pipelines==. 
	- Check [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/698078bc-a34c-8009-bd8d-a53183e6de0f) out.
	- We roll out chapters and they have a high rate of satisfaction
	- We are on track to do 60 by the end of the year
	- EO renews in June. High success means they hire more and expand.
## QLD & BKK
- Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.
- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
