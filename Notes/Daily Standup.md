- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Last Friday I had an interview with Arlene, our Sales Qualification Rep to help her with the dashboards and other interfaces in HubSpot.
- So I'll start the day by building the Outreach workflow to help her with the email and whatsapp message automation.

- You too. You deserve so much more than this; considering all the things you've done for the company so far.

## Build this workflow

- FIRST OUTREACH-SEND AN E-MAIL TO PROSPECT (for those with e-mail address on our record).
- SECOND OUTREACH-SEND A WHATSAPP MESSAGE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WHATSAPP NUMBER ON OUR FILE. - FOR THOSE WHO WILL RESPOND (INTERESTED), SEND A CALENDAR INVITE FOR A SCHEDULED CALL. - FOR THOSE WHO WON’T RESPOND, DO ANOTHER OUTREACH by sending E-MAIL/WHATSAPP MESSAGES.
  > Inspect how similar it is to the existing `WF – Deal – Rise → Membership Package Outreach Sequence` and build it from there.
