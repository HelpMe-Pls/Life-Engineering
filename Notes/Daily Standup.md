- Thanks, `name`.  Good morning everyone. Last Friday I joined the EO Bangkok rollout meeting, so there were a few things that we needed to do following up on it. One of them is to create a data mapping document to show the chapter how we would migrate their existing attributes in the Monday app that they're using to HubSpot.
- So the main thing today is to review the data mapping dictionary that we created for Queensland to prepare for the meeting tomorrow.

- You too. You deserve so much more than this; considering all the things you've done for the company so far.

# HubSpot
> I'm a software engineer over at Edge8, and I also handle the technical support for any HubSpot issues that pop up in the EO Chapters.


1. Get them excited, why HubSpot makes sense (centralized and properly structured). Show 'em the dashboards.
2. Next Friday: actual rollout
3. What they're gonna do (steps they need to take): 
	1. Give us your context give us the exports of the things that you have
	2. We're gonna support them with the config
> Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.

- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
## Task
- Data & props mapping from Monday to HubSpot
