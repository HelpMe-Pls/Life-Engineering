- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Last Friday I built the SAP renewal pipelines in HubSpot to handle the term renewal stages for SAPs.
- So the main thing today for me is to wrap up the Bangkok data migration doc and then build the corresponding workflows for the SAP renewal pipeline. 

> Update APAC doc to include new pipelines
> Create another "[Stage Action]([WF – Deal – Member Renewal - Stage Actions | HubSpot](https://app-na2.hubspot.com/workflows/243769902/platform/flow/3521654515/edit)" workflow for SAP to handle tasks.

1. Get them excited, why HubSpot makes sense (centralized and properly structured). Show 'em the dashboards.
2. Next Friday: actual rollout
3. What they're gonna do (steps they need to take): 
	1. Give us your context give us the exports of the things that you have
	2. We're gonna support them with the config
> Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.

- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
## Task
- Data & props mapping from Monday to HubSpot
- Lifecycle of Members and SAP
