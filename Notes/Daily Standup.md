- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Yesterday I set up the dashboards and reports for Queensland, and I also made a list of the properties we're still missing.
- So the main thing today for me is to keep working on the Queensland setup to add the missing props and reports, then clean up the Views and Segments.

## For the record
- For the record, I think I'll just quickly walk through what we're working on at EO so you get the idea.
- So now that we’re part of EO Global, I think we’ll know we’re really hitting the mark when we roll out chapters and they’re showing a high satisfaction rate.
- And EO renews around June, so if we nail it, that usually means they hire more and expand. 
- So our job is to make the chapter setup simple enough that people can track the two growth levers—retention and acquisition—with the 8% NET new growth goal each year. 
- Leading indicators to watch are clean data and the leads-to-opportunities numbers in the deal funnel. And if we can scale that to 60 chapters by the end of the year, you’re basically looking at at least a 30% raise.
> You too. To be fair, if I were the boss, I'd have doubled your salary by now. You deserve so much more than this; considering all the things you've done for the company so far.

## Key metrics
- Chapters are able to track their two levers of growth, member retention and member acquisition with a goal of 8% NET new growth every year.
	- The leading indicators of this is <u>data cleanliness</u> and `number of leads` to `number of opportunities` from a deal funnel perspective → ==figure out the related deal pipelines==. 
	- Check [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/698078bc-a34c-8009-bd8d-a53183e6de0f) out.
	- As we're part of EO Global, we'd know we hit the mark when we roll out chapters and they have a high rate of satisfaction.
	- EO renews in June. High success means they hire more and expand.
	- We are on track to do 60 chapters by the end of the year.
## QLD & BKK
- Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.
- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
