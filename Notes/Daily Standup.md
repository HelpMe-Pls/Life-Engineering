- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Last Friday I built the SAP renewal pipelines in HubSpot to handle the term renewal stages for SAPs.
- So the main thing today for me is to wrap up the Bangkok data migration doc and then update the APAC doc to include new pipelines as well as create another [Stage Action]([WF – Deal – Member Renewal - Stage Actions | HubSpot](https://app-na2.hubspot.com/workflows/243769902/platform/flow/3521654515/edit) workflow for the tasks related to the SAP Renewal pipeline.

- Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.
- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
