- Thanks, `name`. Yesterday we had an overview of what we did for the last sprint
- So the main thing today for me is to keep working on the Queensland setup and make sure that the things we built run properly before the global demo this friday.

> I'd love to hear your comments on Monday about how we can make Vietnam perfect so I am never surprised again with avoidable problems demo'ing at a global event.

# 1-1
- You too. You deserve so much more than this; considering all the things you've done for the company so far.

## Key metrics
- Chapters are able to track their two levers of growth, member retention and member acquisition with a goal of 8% net new growth every year.
	- The leading indicators of this is <u>data cleanliness</u> from our perspective and `number of leads` to `number of opportunities` from a deal funnel perspective → ==figure out the related deal pipelines==. 
	- Check [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/698078bc-a34c-8009-bd8d-a53183e6de0f) out.
## QLD & BKK
- Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.
- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
