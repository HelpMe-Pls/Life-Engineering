- Thanks, `name`. Yesterday I resolved several HubSpot related issues that we have for the reports and the onboarding track pipeline
- So the main thing today for me is to review the work we've done for this sprint to prepare for tomorrow sprint review and make sure that the things we built run properly before the global demo this friday.

> I'd love to hear your comments on Monday about how we can make Vietnam perfect so I am never surprised again with avoidable problems demo'ing at a global event.

# 1-1
- You too. You deserve so much more than this; considering all the things you've done for the company so far.

## Key metrics
- Chapters are able to track their two levers of growth, member retention and member acquisition with a goal of 8% net new growth every year.
	- The leading indicators of this is <u>data cleanliness</u> from our perspective and `number of leads` to `number of opportunities` from a deal funnel perspective → ==figure out the related deal pipelines==.

## QLD & BKK
- Prefer native HubSpot props if they're asking about data. Tell them to refer to the data dictionary before making changes to the props or pipelines.
- Monday: CRM (too flexible, they're struggling with structure: centralized records tracking everything in one place, and that's what they're expecting from HubSpot to solve that structured system)
	- Same record duplicated in multiple tables without a relationship/connection between any of them
- Plausible -> Calendy: automation and meeting schedule connected to Monday
