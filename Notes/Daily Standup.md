- Thanks, `name`. Good morning everyone. Uhm, last week I was working with Dave to wrap up the HubSpot data issues that we're having for EOVN.
- For today I'll wrap up the remaining tasks of this sprint to get ready for tomorrow's sprint review.

- I'm gonna try to cleanup the code a bit, but for the most part I think I'll be focusing on HubSpot automation unless something urgent pops up.
