### 2/2
- HubSpot issues:
	- Members is up to 36 but `New members` is still 6: `New Members` are filtered by `Membership Start Date`. So what's the expected filter here? `Create date` instead?
	- The newest member is not even in the deal funnel: figure out where they're at and how should we move them to deals (sth wrong with the workflows or are we missing some manual config steps?)
	- `Member Renewal`: should automatically populate all active members, NOT test data
	- The automation is calling it onboarding but the rest say year one: rename the deals?
	- 31 in forum stats but 37 members: should we update those manually or do we have a workflow for this but it's not running properly? Does he mean that all of the 37 members (contacts) should also have a defined value in their `Forum` prop?
	- Check what's wrong with the dashboard: add `Shadow` to the filters [here](https://app-na2.hubspot.com/reports-dashboard/243769902/view/137904140/266525566)
	- ==Secondary member is something we didn’t account for. We will need to figure it out.==
