# CSRF
- Cross-Site Request Forgery, is a type of web security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a victim into performing actions they did not intend to on a web application where they're authenticated. It's a good general practice to apply CSRF protection to ***all requests that modify data***.
- To prevent CSRF vulnerabilities, there are a few foundational principles:
	1. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**: These are unique tokens generated by the server and sent to the client during session establishment. If a request doesn't have the token, it will be denied.
	2. **SameSite Cookies**: Setting it to `Strict` or `Lax` will ensure that the cookie isn't sent with cross-site requests.
	3. **Check the Origin Header**: Servers can check the `Origin` and `Referer` headers of incoming requests. If the request's origin isn't what the server expects, it can reject the request.
	4. **Always Logout**: Encourage users to log out of sessions when they're done, especially on public or shared computers. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker.
